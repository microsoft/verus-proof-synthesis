/*
 This lemma is often useful to put near the end of a loop body that has a loop invariant involving Seq::take(i), with i being the loop index.
 Example usage:
    while ( k < s.len() )
      invariant
          ...
          k <= s.len(),
          ...s@.take(k as int)...,
          ...
    {
       ...
       k = k + 1;
       proof{
        lemma_seq_take_ascend(s@, k as int);
       }
    }
*/
proof fn lemma_seq_take_ascend<T>(v: Seq<T>, i: int)
    requires
        0 < i <= v.len(),
    ensures
        v.take(i as int).drop_last() == v.take(i-1),
{
    assert(v.take(i as int).drop_last()=~=v.take(i-1));
