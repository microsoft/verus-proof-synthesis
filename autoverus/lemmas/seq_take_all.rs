/*
 This lemma is often useful to put right after a loop that has a loop invariant involving Seq::take(i), with i being the loop index.
 Example usage:
    while ( k < s.len() )
      invariant
          ...
          k <= s.len(),
          ...s@.take(k as int)...,
          ...
    {
       ...
       k = k + 1;
    }
	lemma_seq_take_all(s@);
*/
proof fn lemma_seq_take_all<T>(v: Seq<T>)
    ensures
        v == v.take(v.len() as int),
{
    assert(v =~= v.take(v.len() as int));
}
