Verus failed to prove that one of the loop invariants is satisfied at the end of every loop iteraiton.

Please check the failing loop invariant specified below.

Then, please add an assertion (in proof block) about this failed loop invariant at the end of the loop body (NOT after the loop), so that this loop invariant can be explicitly evaluated by Verus at the end of each loop iteration.

If you think the failed invariant is incorrect, you can delete/correct it.

Only make the minimal changes necessary to fix the invariant error.
