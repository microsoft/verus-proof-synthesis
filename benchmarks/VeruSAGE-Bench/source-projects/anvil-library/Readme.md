Benchmarks in this folder originate from two folders of lemma functions in [Anvil](https://github.com/anvil-verifier/anvil/).

All proof functions in the [temporal_logic](https://github.com/anvil-verifier/anvil/tree/main/src/temporal_logic) folder and the [vstd_ext](https://github.com/anvil-verifier/anvil/tree/main/src/vstd_ext) folder that requires proof annotations were extracted and put here.

Many thanks to the Anvil authors who kindly explained to us the structure of Anvil and demonstrated to us how to compile and verify the original Anvil project.
