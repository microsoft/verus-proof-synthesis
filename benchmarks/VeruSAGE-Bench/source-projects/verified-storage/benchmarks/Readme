Here we have 80+ stand-alone Verus programs that can be verified. 

They come from the Verified Storage project
https://github.com/microsoft/verified-storage

Each verifiable function (i.e., proof or exec) in the following folders of the
original Verified Storage project are extracted together with all its 
dependencies needed for verification into a stand-alone file.
* storage_node/src/log/*_v 
* storage_node/src/pmem/*_v

There might be some files whose names start with ``note''.
Those files include comments explaining how to figure out the proof step by
step.

All the verifiable functions from file X in the original project are put into
folder D_X here, with D representing the original folder X is located (e.g.,
log or pmem). The file name is based on the name of the verifiable function in
the original project. When the function is a proof/lemma function, a letter
"L" is used in the file name; otherwise, if the original function is an
executable function, no "L" is used.

To get the statistics of all or part of these files, you can run get_stats.ps1

./get_stats.ps1 -dir <optional sub-directory name> -name <optional name
substring>

To verify all or part of these files, you can run verify_all.ps1

./verify_all.ps1 -dir <optional sub-directory name> -name <optional name
substring>
