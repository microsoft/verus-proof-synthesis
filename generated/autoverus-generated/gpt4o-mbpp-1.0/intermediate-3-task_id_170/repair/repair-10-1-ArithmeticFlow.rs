            arr.len() == arr.len(), // Loop invariant specifying the length of the array
            forall |k: int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> arr[k as int] == arr[k as int], // Adding this invariant since arr is never modified in the loop
            index < arr.len(), // Invariant about the array index not out of bounds
            i128::MIN <= sum + (arr[(index) as int] as i128) <= i128::MAX // Ensure no overflow/underflow
    {
        assert(i128::MIN <= sum + arr[index] as i128 && sum + arr[index] as i128 <= i128::MAX);
        
        sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
        index += 1;
    }
    sum
}
} 

In the above code, we added an assertion:
rust
assert(i128::MIN <= sum + arr[index] as i128 && sum + arr[index] as i128 <= i128::MAX);
right before the line where the addition takes place:
rust
sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;

We also updated the loop invariant to ensure it covers both lower and upper bounds:
rust
i128::MIN <= sum + (arr[(index) as int] as i128) <= i128::MAX


//         sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
//   None: sum + arr[index] as i128
