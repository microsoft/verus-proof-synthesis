Given the reported issue, it seems like the verification engine is failing to recognize the loop invariant as true at the start of the loop. One potential problem might be that the loop invariant is too strong or not true at the beginning of the loop due to its formulation. The invariant 
forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]) 
might not hold when `index` is 0 at the start of the loop (since there might not be any `i, j` that satisfies `0 <= i < j <= index + 1` just before the loop starts or the way it's stated might not reflect your intended condition correctly).

The invariant is trying to assert that for any valid `i` and `j` where `i < j` and `j` is not more than `index + 1` and less than the length of the array, `arr[j]` should be exactly 1 more than `arr[i]`. This is true inside the loop once you start comparing elements, but might not hold or be necessary to hold before the first iteration.

To correct this situation, let's adjust the invariant so it better reflects the loop's behavior and verifies successfully:

1. Revisit the invariant so it reflects properties that are certainly true at the start of the loop.
2. Recognizing the intention is to ensure elements are consecutive as checked inside the loop, we're primarily interested in neighboring elements’ relationships. Thus, the condition might be overly convoluted for verifying the property of interest.

A potential correction might be to adjust the invariant's range, ensuring the first part ("index < arr.len()") is more directly applicable and relatable to the loop’s operational start and progress. However, the original logic behind stating "`forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j])`" needs reviewing as its aim might already be captured by the loop's operational checks.

Here’s how to correct the invariants to something more verifiable:

1. Ensure it's clear that the invariant needs to hold immediately before the loop starts, which implies focusing on the loop initialization phase (when `index = 0`). 
2. Since the loop examines sequential pairs `(arr[index], arr[index + 1])`, and given the complaint is that your invariant doesn't hold from the start, let's correct this specification to closely match what the code does: ensure consecutive elements have the intended property.

Let's correct the invariant to reflect the simple property that consecutive elements up to `index` meet the condition:

Additionally, since the complaint is that the invariant does not hold at the beginning, replacing it with a simpler, more applicable invariant that only starts enforcing the constraint when `index` has been incremented at least once might work better.

If the intention was indeed to ensure elements are consecutive in a more straightforward manner checked directly in the loop, the complicated invariant might not be necessary at all. Instead, a simpler assertion or invariant expressing this specific step-by-step property could be more appropriate:
            arr.len() > 0,
            forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> (0 <= # [trigger] arr[i] + 1 < i32::MAX),
            index < arr.len() - 1, // More precise control-related invariant
            forall|i: int| 0 <= i <= index ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[i+1]), // Simplified to reflect intended checks

This proposed change makes the invariant: "For all indices `i` up to current `index`, `arr[i] + 1` is equal to `arr[i + 1]`." This directly supports the loop's checking mechanism and is undoubtedly true at the start since the range is empty before the first iteration, hence trivially satisfied.

Remember, the exact correction might vary based on deeper intentions in the existing logic not fully captured in the provided snippet. If your core logic indeed required the comprehensive range and comparison as initially specified, the verification failure might demand revisiting the premise of the loop or the integrity of data before entering it, ensuring that all conditions necessary for your invariant are correctly established and maintained.

//             forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]),
//   None: forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j])
