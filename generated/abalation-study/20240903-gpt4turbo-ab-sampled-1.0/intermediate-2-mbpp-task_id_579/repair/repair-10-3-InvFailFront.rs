The loop invariant you're asking to correct at line 55, `forall|i: int| 0 <= i < result.len() ==> (!arr1@.contains(#[trigger] result[i]))`, indeed could fail at the beginning of the loop because at that point, the `result` vector might not have been initialized correctly according to the invariant, especially if there are elements in `arr2` that also exist in `arr1`.

The issue you're facing can be that at the beginning of the loop, before any iterations occur, we cannot assume that the elements of `result` do not exist in `arr1` without first initializing `result` in a manner that ensures this. The invariant must also hold when the loop starts, which is when `result` is an empty vector.

To correctly address this invariant, you can establish that it is trivially true for an empty `result` vector before the loop, which is the case when the loop just starts. As elements are only added to `result` under a condition that ensures they don't exist in both `arr1` and `arr2`, and as the loop invariants in each while loop ensure that no duplicates are added from each respective array, this invariant should be maintained naturally if your logic for adding elements to `result` is correct.

However, since Verus is complaining, it suggests that we need to prove or assert this fact explicitly before the loop starts to make it clear to the verification engine that this condition holds. Adding an assertion before the problematic loop can help, but since your program currently does not perform such pre-loop assertions explicitly, the most straightforward fix is ensuring the logic in your code correctly establishes the invariant from the start of each loop. The invariant might not need adjustment if you can assert its truth at the beginning of the loop.

Given the code you have, the invariant itself is not wrong, and adding it as an assert right before the loop wouldn't directly solve the verification issue, as the invariant needs to hold true throughout the loop, including at its start.

One approach to help the verification engine might be to explicitly prove that the `result` vector satisfies the invariant when the loop starts. This would typically be done through assertions or by structuring the code such that it's evident to the verifier that `result` does not contain elements of `arr1` when the second loop begins. However, looking at your specific code, your logic should naturally preserve the invariant if `result` indeed does not contain elements from `arr1` at the beginning of the second loop, given that elements are only added after checking against both `arr1` and `arr2`.

The most applicable advice here is double-checking the conditions under which elements are added to `result` and ensuring that they are strict enough to maintain the invariant. Otherwise, you might need to provide more explicit proof through assertions or rephrasing of your loop conditions to make the invariant maintenance evident to Verus.

One potential misunderstanding could stem from the use of `arr1@` and `result@`, which are not standard Rust notations nor directly understandable without specific context from the Verus paradigm. Assuming this syntax is meant to express some form of state capture or dereferencing under Verus's verification context (e.g., denoting the original array at the function's start vs. its potentially mutated state during execution), it's crucial to ensure such nuances are correctly employed to maintain invariant veracity.
