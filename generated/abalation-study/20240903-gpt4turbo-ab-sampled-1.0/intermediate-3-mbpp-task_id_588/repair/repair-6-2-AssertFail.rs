The code snippet you've provided computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values found in a vector of integers. The problematic assertion is intended to ensure that the subtraction resulting in the difference does not overflow the bounds of an `i32`. 

The assertion that is failing checks that the difference between `max_val` and `min_val`, when both are cast to `int` (essentially `i64` in `vstd`), does not exceed `i32::MAX` converted to `int`. Since both `max_val` and `min_val` are `i32` values, and knowing that Rust (and this mathematical model, in extension), should inherently avoid overflow for operations within the bounds of the type, it may seem at first glance that this assertion is unnecessary. Yet, when they are cast to `int`, the operation's result could potentially exceed the range of an `i32`, which is what this assertion aims to protect against. However, given the precondition that all elements of the array are within half the range of `i32`, this specific overflow should not be a concern.

Given the range restrictions placed on the elements of the array (that is, they must be between `i32::MIN / 2` and `i32::MAX / 2`), the maximum possible difference between any two elements cannot exceed `i32::MAX`, satisfying the assertion by the nature of these constraints without requiring an explicit proof. 

This situation suggests that the assertion might be failing due to a problem in communicating these range constraints and their implications for the operation in question, rather than an actual logical error in the code. Therefore, the direct solution would be to revisit the range constraints and ensure they are properly understood and considered by the verifier tool. If the tool still fails to infer the correctness, explicit proof steps or additional invariants might be required to guide the verifier.

Here, it appears that we may not need a significant change to the logic of your code; rather, a clearer expression of the derivation from preconditions to the safe subtraction might suffice. However, without direct feedback from the tool or additional mechanisms within the codebase to assert these relationships, it's challenging to provide a targeted fix.

Given the code as it stands, one potential way forward without altering constraints or the broader logic is to reinforce the relationship between the range constraints on `arr` elements and the resultant safe range for subtraction directly in the assertion comments or through additional proof steps. However, since I am providing adjustments without the ability to interact with tool feedback directly, specific syntax for these enhancements would be speculative.

Your code is logically sound based on the shared constraints and goals, so focusing on clarifying the computational model's understanding of how the conditions ensure safe subtraction is key.
