// Before performing subtraction, we assert the safety of the operation
// To do this, we can simply ensure both min_val and max_val respect their domain's limitations.
// This assertion acts as a further clarification for Verus, though in principle, given the input constraints,
// overflow/underflow shouldn't occur. 
// The assertion below ensures that the subtraction is safe by leveraging the facts about sequence bounds and 
// arithmetic properties.
assert!(max_val >= min_val); // This ensures there's no underflow.

Here's how you can incorporate it into your code:

rust
#![verifier::loop_isolation(false)]
use vstd::math::*;
use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}
verus! {

// Your other spec and function definitions here...

fn difference_max_min(arr: &Vec<i32>) -> (diff: i32)
    requires
        arr.len() > 0,
        forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> i32::MIN / 2 < #[trigger] arr[i] < i32::MAX / 2,
    ensures
        diff == max_rcur(arr@) - min_rcur(arr@),
{
    // Definitions and the loop...

    // Assertion before performing subtraction to ensure no underflow/overflow
    assert!(max_val >= min_val); // This ensures there's no underflow.

    // Perform the subtraction safely after assertion.
    max_val - min_val
}
} // verus!


//     max_val - min_val
//   None: max_val - min_val

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 2
// Safe: False
