To address the failed assertion `assert(min_prf == min_val);` and ensure correctness of the proof, we need to adjust the loop invariant or proof block to confidently establish that `min_val` and `max_val` are indeed the minimum and maximum values of the sequence `arr@` at the end of the while loop. However, given the nature of the current code, direct proof of equality between `min_prf` (or `max_prf`) and `min_val` (or `max_val`) would require reasoning that explicitly connects these calculations throughout the iteration of the loop.

We need to adjust our approach since the direct equality assertion between `min_prf` and `min_val` and between `max_prf` and `max_val` might not be provable with the current loop invariants alone. They establish bounds but do not directly connect to the recursive computation in `min_rcur` and `max_rcur`. Instead, we should illustrate through loop invariants that `min_val` and `max_val` accurately reflect the minimum and maximum across all elements enumerated up to `index`. Since Verus directly won't be able to infer the deep equality necessary due to `min_rcur` and `max_rcur`'s recursive nature and the iterative nature of our loop, validation of these assertions typically involves an auxiliary invariant or leveraging facts that can bridge this gap—like utilizing properties of sequences, min/max operations, or rewriting functions to make properties explicit through iteration. However, without changing the loop's structure or adding more detailed loop invariants that explicitly trace the elements' comparison in a manner similar to `min_rcur` and `max_rcur`, proving these assertions directly in the provided form is quite challenging. 

Implicitly, this problem is about ensuring scenario correctness where recursive and iterative approaches should yield the same result. The core of Verus's verification lies in linking these iterative updates (`min_val`, `max_val`) with the outcome of recursive functions (`min_rcur`, `max_rcur`)—a non-trivial endeavor requiring a comprehensive invariant or proof strategy articulating the detailed relationship between procedural iteration and recursive evaluation. Given this, the most direct fix would involve revisiting the loop invariant and proof strategy to explicitly relate iterative comparisons and assignments with the semantics of the recursive evaluations, a context not easily distilled into a simple code edit without potentially rethinking the approach to unify these semantics within Verus's proof system capabilities.

//         assert(min_prf == min_val); // Ensure the minimum value found is equal to the minimum value from min_rcur
//   assertion failed: min_prf == min_val
