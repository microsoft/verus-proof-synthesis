// Insert this assertion before `counter += 1;`
assert!(counter < arr.len(), "Counter is about to overflow");

In a more complex scenario, where we have a recursive function that doesn't tie as cleanly to array lengths or has a more complex relationship with bounds, you may need a lemma function to prove something about the monotonicity or boundedness of your operation. For our case, the direct relationship between `counter` and `arr.len()` means we can assert safety directly.

Here's the modified loop section with the added assertion:

rust
...
while index < arr.len()
    invariant
        counter == count_frequency_rcr(arr@.subrange(0, index as int), key),
        index <= arr.len(),
        arr.len() == arr.len(), // Keeps the length of the array arr
{
    if (arr[index] == key) {
        // Ensure counter doesn't overflow by asserting it's less than arr's length before incrementing,
        // which is a practical maximum bound in this scenario.
        assert!(counter < arr.len()); // This assertion prevents counter overflow
        counter += 1;
    }
    index += 1;
}
...


//             counter += 1;
//   None: counter += 1
