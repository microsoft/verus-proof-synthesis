The logic here seems sound, and there are no evident proof-related discrepancies inside the code itself. The specifications (`spec fn`) and proofs inside the loop seem consistent for verifying non-primality.

Given the provided code, here are some suggestions to ensure you can run it successfully:

1. **Check Verus Environment**:
    Ensure your Verus tool install correctly and the command you're using to run the verification doesn't contain syntax issues or unintended file inputs.
   
2. **Single File Execution**:
    Make sure you execute or verify a single Rust file at a time to avoid the `multiple input filenames` issue. If your current working directory or command parses multiple files inadvertently, this error can occur.

3. **Compilation**:
    Double-check the compiler or verifier command you used to ensure it's formatted correctly without including stray file paths or extra options.

Here is how it should be expected in the command line for execution typically:
sh
verus file_name.rs


// error: multiple input filenames provided (first two filenames are `` and `/tmp/tmpgoyaw9_c`)
// 

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 8
// Safe: False
