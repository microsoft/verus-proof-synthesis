This code should work correctly with Verus assuming the environment is set up correctly.

Here’s a quick checklist to make sure everything runs smoothly:
1. **Ensure Verus is correctly installed**: Make sure Verus and its dependencies are correctly installed on your system.
2. **Run the verification with the proper command**: If you're using a script or command line to run the verification, make sure it correctly points to a single source file.

If the error persists:
- Double-check the command you use to invoke Verus.
- Make sure there isn’t an issue with your script or IDE configuration that might be inadvertently providing multiple filenames.
  
For instance, you’d typically run Verus with a command like:

sh
verus your_filename.rs

Where `your_filename.rs` is the Rust file containing your Verus script.

In case there is still an issue, try isolating and running the Verus part explicitly from a command line to rule out any tooling issues:

- Export the Verus part to a separate file (e.g. `fib.rs`) and run Verus directly on it. For instance:

rust
use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}

verus! {
    #[verifier::loop_isolation(false)]

    spec fn fibo(n: int) -> nat
        decreases n,
    {
        if n <= 0 {
            0
        } else if n == 1 {
            1
        } else {
            fibo(n - 2) + fibo(n - 1)
        }
    }

    spec fn fibo_fits_i32(n: int) -> bool {
        fibo(n) < 0x8000_0000
    }

    fn fibonacci(n: usize) -> (ret: Vec<i32>)
        requires
            fibo_fits_i32(n as int),
            n >= 2,
        ensures
            forall|i: int| 2 <= i < n ==> #[trigger] ret@[i] == fibo(i),
            ret@.len() == n,
    {
        let mut fib = Vec::new();
        fib.push(0);
        fib.push(1);
        let mut i = 2;
        while i < n
            invariant
                2 <= i <= n,
                fib.len() == i,
                fibo_fits_i32(n as int),
                forall|j: int| 0 <= j < i ==> #[trigger] fib@[j] == fibo(j as int),
        {
            let next_fib = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
            fib.push(next_fib);
            i += 1;
        }

        fib
    }
} // verus!

And then run:

sh
verus fib.rs
