Make sure to run the correct command to verify the code and pass the appropriate file. To avoid the `multiple input filenames provided` error, ensure you're calling the Verus tool with a single file path as an argument. The issue you faced seems related to the invocation method of the tool rather than the code itself.

If you're using Verus directly, the command might look something like this (assuming `verus` is the command and `prime.rs` is your file):

bash
verus path/to/prime.rs


// error: multiple input filenames provided (first two filenames are `` and `/tmp/tmpuubgfkvs`)
// 

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 9
// Safe: False
