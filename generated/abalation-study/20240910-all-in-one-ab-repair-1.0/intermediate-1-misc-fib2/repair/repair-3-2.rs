Here's an explanation for each invariant specified:
- `2 <= i <= n`: Ensures that `i` always stays within the bounds of the sequence.
- `fib.len() == i`: This ensures that the length of the vector `fib` is always equal to the counter `i`.
- `fibo_fits_i32(n as int)`: This reaffirms the requirement that Fibonacci numbers should fit within the `i32` limit.
- `forall|j: int| 0 <= j < i ==> #[trigger] fib[j] == fibo(j)`: This ensures every element in `fib` calculated thus far indeed matches the mathematical Fibonacci series `fibo` up to the current index `i`.

Addressing the multiple input filenames error could be due to a setup or some command-line arguments issue. Make sure you are running the Verus tool properly by invoking it with a single file argument, typically something like:

sh
verus hhhh.rs


// error: multiple input filenames provided (first two filenames are `` and `/tmp/tmpmv2hmcrf`)
// 

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 24
// Safe: False
