It seems that the loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is failing at the beginning of the loop. This means that the invariant doesn't hold when the loop starts.

There are a few ways to handle this issue:
1. **Correct the Loop Invariant**: Ensure that the loop invariant is correct and holds at the beginning of the loop. This might involve inspecting the logic of the loop and the invariant to check for any inconsistencies.
2. **Add as an Assert Before the Loop**: If the loop invariant cannot be corrected or if it's known to hold true before the loop starts, it can be added as an assert right before the loop.
3. **Add to Preceding Loops**: If there are multiple loops in the program and the invariant should hold for all of them, the invariant can be added to all preceding loops.

Once you've decided on the appropriate approach, you can proceed to update the code accordingly. If you need further assistance with any specific approach, feel free to ask!

//   None: forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))
