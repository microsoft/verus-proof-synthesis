It seems like the loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is failing before the loop starts.

In the given code, the loop invariant is supposed to ensure that the sum of elements in the subrange from 0 to the current index `k` is equal to the sum of elements in the subrange from 0 to the current `index`. However, it's failing because the sum of elements in the subrange from 0 to the current index `k` might not be equal to the sum of elements in the subrange from 0 to the current `index` at the beginning of the loop.

To fix this issue, you can add the loop invariant as an assertion right before the loop to ensure it holds initially. Alternatively, you may need to adjust the loop invariant to make it hold at the beginning of the loop. It's important to ensure that the loop invariant accurately reflects the state of the program at the loop's entry and exit points.

I would suggest reviewing the loop invariant and verifying that it accurately captures the intended property of the loop. If necessary, you can modify the loop invariant or add additional assertions to establish the desired property before the loop begins.

//   None: forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))
