It seems that Verus is reporting a failed invariant before the loop. The loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is not holding at the beginning of the loop.

Looking at the code, it seems that the loop invariant is trying to establish the relationship between the values of the `sum_to` function applied to subranges of the `arr` sequence and the current `index`.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the loop invariant for the while loop in the `sum` function is attempting to ensure that the sum of elements from the beginning of the array up to index `k` is equal to the sum of elements from the beginning of the array up to the current index.

To address this issue, the `sum` function may need to be adjusted to correctly maintain the loop invariant. It's important to ensure that the loop invariant holds true at the beginning of the loop and is maintained throughout the loop execution.

Furthermore, consider whether the loop invariant can be feasibly maintained by the loop body. The loop invariant should not depend on any loop variable that changes during the iteration, otherwise, it may be difficult to uphold.

Lastly, if the loop invariant cannot be maintained within the loop, it might be necessary to consider a different approach, such as restructuring the loop or moving the invariant to a different part of the program.

I recommend revisiting the loop invariant and the implementation of the `sum` function to ensure that the loop invariant holds true at the beginning of the loop and is properly maintained throughout its execution. Additionally, consider whether the loop body is capable of maintaining the loop invariant as expected.
