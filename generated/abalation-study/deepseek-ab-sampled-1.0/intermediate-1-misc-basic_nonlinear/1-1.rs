Here is a step-by-step explanation and proof of the function `bound_check`:

**Step 1: Understanding the Function's Purpose**

The function `bound_check` takes two unsigned 32-bit integers, `x` and `y`, and ensures that their product does not exceed a 32-bit value, specifically `0x100000000` (which is \( 2^{32} \) or 4,294,967,296 in decimal).

**Step 2: Analyzing the Bounds of x and y**

The requires clause specifies:
- \( 0 \leq x \leq 0xFFFF \) (which is 65,535 in decimal)
- \( 0 \leq y \leq 0xFFFF \) (which is also 65,535 in decimal)

These are the maximum values for unsigned 16-bit integers. Thus, both `x` and `y` are effectively 16-bit numbers despite being stored in 32-bit variables.

**Step 3: Calculating the Maximum Possible Product**

The maximum value each variable can take is 65,535. Therefore, the maximum product occurs when both `x` and `y` are at their maximum:

\[
\text{Maximum Product} = 65,535 \times 65,535
\]

Calculating this:

\[
65,535 \times 65,535 = (65,536 - 1)^2 = 65,536^2 - 2 \times 65,536 \times 1 + 1^2
\]
\[
= 2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1 = 4,294,967,296 - 131,072 + 1 = 4,294,836,225
\]

**Step 4: Comparing the Maximum Product to \( 2^{32} \)**

The maximum product calculated is:

\[
4,294,836,225 \leq 4,294,967,296
\]

This shows that even when both `x` and `y` are at their maximum values, the product \( x \times y \) does not exceed \( 2^{32} \).

**Step 5: Ensuring All Possible Products Are Within Bounds**

Since both `x` and `y` are constrained to \( \leq 65,535 \), and we've established that the maximum product is less than \( 2^{32} \), it follows that for all allowed values of `x` and `y`, the product \( x \times y \) will satisfy:

\[
x \times y \leq 2^{32} - 1
\]

Therefore, the ensures condition \( x \times y \leq 0x100000000 \) holds true.

**Step 6: Conclusion**

Given that both inputs `x` and `y` are bounded within the unsigned 16-bit range, their product cannot exceed the 32-bit unsigned integer limit of \( 2^{32} - 1 \). Hence, the function `bound_check` correctly ensures that \( x \times y \) does not exceed \( 0x100000000 \), proving the requires and ensures conditions as specified.
