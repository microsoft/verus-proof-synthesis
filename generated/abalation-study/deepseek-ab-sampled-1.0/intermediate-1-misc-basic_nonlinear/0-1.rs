proof fn bound_check(x: u32, y: u32)
    requires
        x <= 0xffff,
        y <= 0xffff,
    ensures
        x*y <= 0x100000000,
{
    // Calculate the maximum possible product of x and y
    let max_product = 0xffff * 0xffff;
    
    // Verify that the computed product does not exceed the limit
    assert(max_product < 0x100000000);

    // Conclude that the product is within the required bound
    assert(x*y <= 0x100000000);
}
}
 
 The proof is established by acknowledging that the maximum possible product of two numbers each less than or equal to 65535 remains within the 32-bit limit of 2^32. Specifically, since 65535 * 65535 equals 4,294,836,225, which is less than 4,294,967,296 (2^32), we conclude that for all x and y meeting the given conditions, x * y will not exceed 2^32.
