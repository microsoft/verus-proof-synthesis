To fix the assertion error, we need to ensure that the product of `x` and `y` does not exceed the maximum allowed value after the multiplication. Since `x` and `y` are both bounded by `0xffff`, their product should not exceed `0xFFFF * 0xFFFF`, which is `0x100000000`. Here's the modified code with the necessary proof blocks added:

use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}

verus! {

proof fn bound_check(x: u32, y: u32)
    requires
        x <= 0xffff,
        y <= 0xffff,
    ensures
        x * y <= 0x100000000,
{
    let x_u64: u64 = x as u64;
    let y_u64: u64 = y as u64;
    let maxrack: u64 = 0xffff as u64;
    // Ensure that the individual values do not exceed the maxrack value
    assert(x_u64 <= maxrack);
    assert(y_u64 <= maxrack);
    
    // Calculate the product after ensuring the individual values are within bounds
    let product = x_u64 * y_u64;
    // Ensure that the product is within the expected maximum value
    assert(product <= maxrack * maxrack);
    
    // Additional assertion to ensure the product does not exceed 0xFFFFFFFF
    assert(maxrack * maxrack <= 0xFFFFFFFF as u64);
    assert(product <= 0xFFFFFFFF as u64);
}

}

//     assert(x_u64 * y_u64 <= maxrack * maxrack);
//   assertion failed: x_u64 * y_u64 <= maxrack * maxrack

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 16
// Safe: False
