To prove that \( x \times y \leq 0x100000000 \) given that \( x \) and \( y \) are 32-bit unsigned integers and \( x \leq y \leq 0xFFFF \):

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Constraints:**
   - \( x \) and \( y \) are 32-bit unsigned integers, meaning their values range from \( 0 \) to \( 2^{32} - 1 \).
   - They are further constrained by \( x \leq y \leq 0xFFFF \), where \( 0xFFFF \) is \( 65535 \) in decimal.

2. **Maximize the Product:**
   - The product \( x \times y \) reaches its maximum when both \( x \) and \( y \) are at their maximum allowed values.
   - Thus, the maximum product occurs at \( x = y = 0xFFFF \) (i.e., \( 65535 \)).

3. **Calculate the Maximum Product:**
   \[
   65535 \times 65535 = 4,294,836,225
   \]
   - Convert \( 0x100000000 \) to decimal: \( 2^{32} = 4,294,967,296 \).

4. **Compare the Maximum Product with the Upper Bound:**
   - Since \( 4,294,836,225 < 4,294,967,296 \), it follows that \( x \times y \leq 0x100000000 \).

5. **General Proof for All Valid \( x \) and \( y \):**
   - For any \( x \leq y \leq 0xFFFF \), the product \( x \times y \) will not exceed \( 0x100000000 \).
   - This is because the maximum possible product under these constraints is less than \( 0x100000000 \).

**Conclusion:**
Given \( 0 \leq x \leq y \leq 0xFFFF \), the product \( x \times y \) will always satisfy \( x \times y \leq 0x100000000 \).
