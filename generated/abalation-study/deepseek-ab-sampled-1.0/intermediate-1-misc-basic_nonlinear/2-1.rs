Alright, after thinking through the problem, here's a step-by-step explanation to prove the lemma:

**Step 1: Understand the Constraints**
- Both `x` and `y` are 16-bit unsigned integers, meaning their maximum values are 0xFFFF (65535 in decimal).
- We need to prove that `x * y` does not exceed 0x100000000 (4,294,967,296 in decimal).

**Step 2: Calculate the Maximum Product**
- The maximum product occurs when both `x` and `y` are at their maximum values:
  `x = 0xFFFF (65535)` and `y = 0xFFFF (65535)`.
- Compute the product:
  `65535 * 65535 = (2^16 - 1)^2`.

**Step 3: Expand the Squared Term**
- Use algebra to expand the expression:
  \[
  (2^{16} - 1)^2 = 2^{32} - 2 \times 2^{16} + 1 = 2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1
  \]

**Step 4: Numerical Evaluation**
- Calculate each term:
  - \(2^{32} = 4,294,967,296\)
  - \(2^{17} = 131,072\)
  - So, \(2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1 = 4,294,967,296 - 131,072 + 1 = 4,294,836,225\)

**Step 5: Compare with 0x100000000**
- The computed maximum product is 4,294,836,225.
- Compare with `0x100000000`, which is 4,294,967,296.
- Since `4,294,836,225 < 4,294,967,296`, the maximum product is indeed less than `0x100000000`.

**Step 6: Verify for Other Cases**
- Consider scenarios where one or both numbers are less than maximum:
  - `x = 0`, `y = 0xFFFF` → `0 * 65535 = 0`
  - `x = 1`, `y = 0xFFFF` → `1 * 65535 = 65535`
  - All these results are significantly less than `0x100000000`.

**Step 7: Consider Data Type Overflow**
- In Rust, a `u32` can hold values up to 4,294,967,295.
- Since our maximum product is 4,294,836,225, it comfortably fits within a `u32`.
- Even the next number, 4,294,836,226, is still well within the `u32` limit.

**Step 8: Conclusion**
- The product of two 16-bit unsigned integers always results in a value less than or equal to `0x100000000`.
- Therefore, the lemma holds true under the given constraints.
