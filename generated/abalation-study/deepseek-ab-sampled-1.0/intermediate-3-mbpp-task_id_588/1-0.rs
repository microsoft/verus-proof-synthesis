Loop Invariants Explanation:

1. **Invariant Initialization**: 
   - The loop starts with `index = 1`, and `min_val` and `max_val` are initialized to `arr[0]`.
   - This sets the initial correct value for `min_val` and `max_val` considering the first element.

2. **Loop Condition and Termination**:
   - The loop continues as long as `index < arr.len()`, ensuring that `index` does not exceed the array bounds.
   - The loop processes each element exactly once.

3. **Invariants within the Loop**:
   - `0 <= index <= arr.len()`: Ensures that `index` remains within valid bounds throughout the loop.
   - `0 <= min_val <= max_val`: Maintains the consistent relationship that `min_val` is always less than or equal to `max_val`.
   - `min_val == min_rcur(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))`: At each iteration, `min_val` correctly represents the minimum of the elements processed so far (`0` to `index`).
   - `max_val == max_rcur(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))`: Similarly, `max_val` correctly represents the maximum of the processed elements.

4. **Invariant Maintenance**:
   - Inside the loop, before updating `min_val` or `max_val`, the code ensures that the current element maintains the invariant.
   - If `arr[index]` is less than or equal to `min_val`, `min_val` is updated to `arr[index]`.
   - If `arr[index]` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is updated to `arr[index]`.
   - After each update, an assertion is made to confirm that `min_val` and `max_val` match the recursive `min_rcur` and `max_rcur` functions applied to the current segment of the array.

5. **Final Assertions**:
   - After the loop completes, `min_val` is assertioned to equal `min_rcur(arr@)`, confirming that it is the minimum of the entire array.
   - Similarly, `max_val` is assertioned to equal `max_rcur(arr@)`, confirming that it is the maximum of the entire array.
   - The function then returns `max_val - min_val`, which is the desired difference.

By integrating these invariants, the code becomes robust against errors, and Verus can effectively verify the function's correctness by checking these conditions at each loop iteration.
