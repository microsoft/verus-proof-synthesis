The issue is that the loop invariant `forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> max_val >= arr[i]` is not valid before the loop runs because `max_val` (and `min_val`) are only initialized to `arr[0]`, which might not be the actual maximum or minimum of the entire array. This invariant needs to be adjusted to only cover the elements that have been processed so far (i.e., the elements up to `index`).

Here is the corrected version of the code:

#![verifier::loop_isolation(false)]
use vstd::math::*;
use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}
verus! {

spec fn max_rcur(seq:Seq<i32>) -> int
    decreases seq.len(),
{
    if seq.len() <= 1 {
        seq.first() as int
    } else {
        max(seq.last() as int, max_rcur(seq.drop_last()))
    }
}

spec fn min_rcur(seq: Seq<i32>) -> int
    decreases seq.len(),
{
    if seq.len() <= 1 {
        seq.first() as int
    } else {
        min(seq.last() as int, min_rcur(seq.drop_last()))
    }
}

fn difference_max_min(arr: &Vec<i32>) -> (diff: i32)
    requires
        arr.len() > 0,
        forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> i32::MIN / 2 < # [trigger] arr[i] < i32::MAX / 2,
    ensures
        diff == max_rcur(arr@) - min_rcur(arr@),
{
    let mut min_val = arr[0];
    let mut max_val = arr[0];
    let mut index = 1;
    // Add an assert to establish the initial state for the invariants
    assert(min_val == arr[0]);
    assert(max_val == arr[0]);
    while index < arr.len()
        invariant
            // Adjusted invariants to only cover processed elements
            forall|i: int| 0 <= i <= index-1 ==> max_val >= arr[i],
            forall|i: int| 0 <= i <= index-1 ==> min_val <= arr[i],
            index <= arr.len(),
            max_val >= arr[index - 1],
            min_val <= arr[index - 1],
            min_val <= max_val,
            forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> i32::MIN / 2 < # [trigger] arr[i] < i32::MAX / 2,
    {
        if (arr[index] <= min_val) {
            min_val = arr[index];
        } else if (arr[index] > max_val) {
            max_val = arr[index];
        }
        index += 1;
    }
    //Assertion added to prevent overflow
    assert(max_val - min_val <= i32::MAX);

    max_val - min_val
}

}

The changes made include:

1. Added an initial assert to establish the initial state of `min_val` and `max_val`.

2. Adjusted the loop invariants to only apply to the elements that have been processed so far (i.e., `0 <= i <= index - 1`), rather than claiming to cover the entire array before any elements have been processed.

3. Kept the invariant `min_val <= max_val` to ensure the range remains valid throughout the loop.

This adjustment makes the invariants logically sound because they only stake claims about the elements that have been processed so far, rather than claiming to have found the absolute maximum and minimum of the entire array in the very first iteration.

//             forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> max_val >= arr[i], // arr is never modified in the loop
//   None: forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> max_val >= arr[i]
