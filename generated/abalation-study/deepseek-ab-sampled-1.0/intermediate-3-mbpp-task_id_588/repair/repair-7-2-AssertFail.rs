use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}

verus! {

spec fn is_even(n: int) -> bool {
    n % 2 == 0
}

proof fn test_exists_succeeds() {
    assert(is_even(4));   // Added a specific even number as an example
    assert(exists|i: int| #[trigger] is_even(i));
}

}

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Problem Identification:**
   - The original assertion `exists|i: int| #[trigger] is_even(i)` was failing because the Verus proof engine couldn't find a specific integer `i` that satisfies the condition.

2. **Solution Approach:**
   - To satisfy the `exists` condition, provide a concrete example of an integer that makes `is_even(i)` true.
   - Choosing `i = 4` is a simple and correct choice since 4 is even.

3. **Code Modification:**
   - Added an explicit assertion `assert(is_even(4));` before the `exists` assertion. This tells the proof engine that 4 is an even number, thus proving the existence of such an `i`.

4. **Verification:**
   - The updated code now has a specific example (4) that demonstrates the existence of an even integer.
   - This change ensures the `exists` assertion passes by providing a clear instance that satisfies the condition.

**Final Code:**

rust
use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}

verus! {

spec fn is_even(n: int) -> bool {
    n % 2 == 0
}

proof fn test_exists_succeeds() {
    assert(is_even(4));   // Added a specific even number as an example
    assert(exists|i: int| #[trigger] is_even(i));
}

}
