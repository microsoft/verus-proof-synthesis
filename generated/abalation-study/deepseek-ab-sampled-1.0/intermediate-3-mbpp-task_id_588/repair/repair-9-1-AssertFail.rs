To fix the assertion error, we need to ensure that the difference between `max_val` and `min_val` does not exceed `i32::MAX`. The problem arises when the difference calculation includes negative numbers, causing the result to exceed `i32::MAX`. 

We can resolve this issue by modifying the loop invariants and introducing a proof block to validate the difference within the allowable bounds. Here's how you can implement the solution:

rust
#![verifier::loop_isolation(false)]
use vstd::math::*;
use vstd::prelude::*;

fn main() {}
verus! {

spec fn max_rcur(seq:Seq<i32>) -> int
    decreases seq.len(),
{
    if seq.len() <= 1 {
        seq.first() as int
    } else {
        max(seq.last() as int, max_rcur(seq.drop_last()))
    }
}

spec fn min_rcur(seq: Seq<i32>) -> int
    decreases seq.len(),
{
    if seq.len() <= 1 {
        seq.first() as int
    } else {
        min(seq.last() as int, min_rcur(seq.drop_last()))
    }
}

fn difference_max_min(arr: &Vec<i32>) -> (diff: i32)
    requires
        arr.len() > 0,
        forall|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() ==> i32::MIN / 2 < #[trigger] arr[i] < i32::MAX / 2,
    ensures
        diff == max_rcur(arr@) - min_rcur(arr@),
{
    let mut min_val = arr[0];
    let mut max_val = arr[0];
    let mut index = 1;
    while index < arr.len()
        invariant
            forall|i: int| 0 <= i < index ==> max_val >= arr[i],


//     assert((max_val as i64) - (min_val as i64) <= i32::MAX as i64);
//   assertion failed: (max_val as i64) - (min_val as i64) <= i32::MAX as i64

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 10
// Safe: False
