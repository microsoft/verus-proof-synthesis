The code above includes loop invariants for both loops to ensure:

1. For the first loop:
   - The index `i` stays within valid bounds.
   - The length of vectors `a` and `sum` remains unchanged.
   - Up to index `i`, `a` elements are either 0 or 1 based on their parity.

2. For the second loop:
   - The index `i` stays within valid bounds.
   - The length of vectors `a` and `sum` remains unchanged.
   - The sum remains non-negative and does not exceed `N`.
   - After each iteration, `sum[0]` accumulates the sum of `a` elements.

These invariants help ensure that Verus can verify the correctness of the function, ultimately proving that `sum[0] <= N`.

Note: The syntax for invariants and the exact way to express them may require adjustment based on the specific requirements and capabilities of Verus. This is a conceptual representation to guide the implementation.
