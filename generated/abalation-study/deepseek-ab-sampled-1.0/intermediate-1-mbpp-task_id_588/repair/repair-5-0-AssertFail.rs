To fix the assertion error where the difference between `max_val` and `min_val` could overflow the `i32` bounds, we compute the difference using a wider type (`i64`), check if it's within the safe range, and then cast it back to `i32`. This ensures the subtraction doesn't cause an overflow.

Here's the corrected code:

rust
#![verifier::loop_isolation(false)]
use vstd::math::*;
use vstd::prelude::*;

fn main() {}
verus! {

spec fn max_rcur(seq: Seq<i32>) -> int
    decreases seq.len(),
{
    if seq.len() <= 1 {
        seq.first() as int
    } else {
        max(seq.last() as int, max_rcur(seq.drop_last()))
    }
}

spec fn min_rcur(seq: Seq<i32>) -> int
    decreases seq.len(),
{
    if seq.len() <= 1 {
        seq.first() as int
    } else {
        min(seq.last() as int, min_rcur(seq.drop_last()))
    }
}

proof fn lemma_monotonic_max(i: nat, j: nat, seq: Seq<i32>)
    requires
        i <= j,
        seq.len() >= j,
    ensures
        max_rcur(Seq::new(j, |k: int| seq[k as int])) >= max_rcur(Seq::new(i, |k: int| seq[k as int])),
    decreases j
{
    if i < j {
        lemma_monotonic_max(i, (j-1) as nat, seq.drop_last());
    }
}

proof fn lemma_monotonic_min(i: nat, j: nat, seq: Seq<i32>)
    requires
        i <= j,
        seq.len() >= j,
    ensures
        min_rcur(Seq::new(i, |k: int| seq[k as int])) <= min_rcur(Seq::new(j, |k: int| seq[k as int])),
    decreases j
{
    if i < j {
        lemma_monotonic_min((i+1) as nat, j, seq.drop_last());
    }
}

            max_val == max_rcur(Seq::new((index) as nat, |i: int| arr[i as int] as i32)),
            min_val == min_rcur(Seq::new((index) as nat, |i: int| arr[i as int] as i32)),
