Now, let's provide a step-by-step explanation to formally prove the statement.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

**Given:**
- `x` and `y` are 32-bit unsigned integers, i.e., `x: u32`, `y: u32`.
- Preconditions:
  - `x <= 0xFFFF` (i.e., `x ≤ 65535` in decimal)
  - `y <= 0xFFFF` (i.e., `y ≤ 65535` in decimal)

**To Prove:**
- Postcondition: `x * y <= 0x100000000` (i.e., `x * y ≤ 4294967296` in decimal)

**Proof:**

1. **Understanding the Range of 16-bit and 32-bit Integers:**
   - A 16-bit unsigned integer can hold values from `0` to `65535` (inclusive).
   - A 32-bit unsigned integer can hold values from `0` to `4294967295` (inclusive). However, `0x100000000` represents `4294967296`, which is exactly one more than the maximum value a 32-bit unsigned integer can hold. Thus, it serves as an upper bound for 32-bit unsigned multiplication results.

2. **Determining Maximum Possible Product:**
   - The maximum value for both `x` and `y` under the given preconditions is `65535`.
   - Calculating the product of these maximum values:
     \[
     65535 \times 65535 = 4,294,836,225
     \]
   - Comparing this product to the postcondition:
     \[
     4,294,836,225 \leq 4,294,967,296
     \]
     This inequality holds true.

3. **General Case for All `x` and `y` Within Preconditions:**
   - For any `x` and `y` such that `0 ≤ x ≤ 65535` and `0 ≤ y ≤ 65535`, the product `x * y` is bounded by:
     \[
     0 \leq x \times y \leq 65535 \times 65535 = 4,294,836,225
     \]
   - Since `4,294,836,225 < 4,294,967,296`, it follows that:
     \[
     x \times y \leq 4,294,967,296
     \]
   - Therefore, for all permissible `x` and `y`, the product `x * y` does not exceed `0x100000000`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** `x = 0` or `y = 0`
     - The product `x * y = 0`, which trivially satisfies `0 ≤ 0x100000000`.
   - **Case 2:** `x = 65535` and `y = 65535`
     - As calculated earlier, `x * y = 4,294,836,225 ≤ 4,294,967,296`.
   - **All Other Cases:** By the above reasoning, all products `x * y` fall within the permissible range.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Under the given preconditions, the product of `x` and `y` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `0x100000000`.
   - Thus, the postcondition `x * y <= 0x100000000` is always satisfied.

**Therefore, the function `bound_check` as defined will always meet its postcondition provided the preconditions are satisfied.**
