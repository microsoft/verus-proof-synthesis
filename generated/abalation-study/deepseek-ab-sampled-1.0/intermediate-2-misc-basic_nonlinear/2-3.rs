Now, to provide a clear step-by-step explanation and proof for the given Verus code:

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Proof:**

**Statement to Prove:**
For all u32 integers `x` and `y` where both `x` and `y` are less than or equal to `0xffff` (65535 in decimal),
the product `x * y` is less than or equal to `0x100000000` (4294967296 in decimal).

**Proof:**

1. **Understand the Bounds of `x` and `y`:**
   - `x` and `y` are of type `u32`, meaning they are unsigned 32-bit integers.
   - The constraints are `x ≤ 0xffff` and `y ≤ 0xffff`.
   - `0xffff` in hexadecimal equals 65535 in decimal, which is \(2^{16} - 1\).

2. **Express `x` and `y` in Terms of Their Maximum Values:**
   - Since `x` and `y` are ≤ 65535, their maximum possible values are 65535.

3. **Compute the Maximum Product `x * y`:**
   - The maximum product occurs when both `x` and `y` are at their maximum values.
   - Therefore, `x * y` ≤ 65535 * 65535.

4. **Calculate 65535 * 65535:**
   - \(65535 = 2^{16} - 1\).
   - Therefore, \(65535 * 65535 = (2^{16} - 1) * (2^{16} - 1)\).
   - Expanding this: \(2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1\).

5. **Convert to Decimal for Clarity:**
   - \(2^{32} = 4294967296\).
   - \(2^{17} = 131072\).
   - So, computing \(2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1 = 4294967296 - 131072 + 1 = 4294836225\).

6. **Compare with `0x100000000`:**
   - `0x100000000` in hexadecimal is equal to 4294967296 in decimal.
   - The computed maximum product is 4294836225, which is less than 4294967296.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Since the maximum possible product of `x` and `y` under the given constraints is \(4294836225 < 4294967296\
