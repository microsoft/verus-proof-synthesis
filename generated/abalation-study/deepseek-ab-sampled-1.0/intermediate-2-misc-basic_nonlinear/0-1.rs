To prove that for two 16-bit unsigned integers \( x \) and \( y \), the product \( x \times y \) does not exceed \( 2^{32} \), we can proceed as follows:

**Proof:**

1. **Define the Range of \( x \) and \( y \):**
   - Since \( x \) and \( y \) are 16-bit unsigned integers, their values are confined to:
     \[
     0 \leq x \leq 0xFFFF \quad \text{and} \quad 0 \leq y \leq 0xFFFF
     \]

2. **Express the Maximum Possible Values:**
   - The maximum value for both \( x \) and \( y \) is \( 0xFFFF \) (i.e., \( 2^{16} - 1 = 65,535 \)).

3. **Calculate the Product of Maximum Values:**
   - The product of \( x \) and \( y \) when both are at their maximum:
     \[
     x \times y = 0xFFFF \times 0xFFFF = (2^{16} - 1) \times (2^{16} - 1)
     \]
   - Expanding the product:
     \[
     (2^{16} - 1)^2 = 2^{32} - 2 \times 2^{16} + 1 = 2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1
     \]
   - Calculate the numerical value:
     \[
     2^{32} = 4,294,967,296 \\
     2^{17} = 131,072 \\
     \]
     \[
     2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1 = 4,294,967,296 - 131,072 + 1 = 4,294,836,225
     \]
   - Note that:
     \[
     4,294,836,225 < 4,294,967,296 = 2^{32}
     \]

4. **Determine the Upper Bound for \( x \times y \):**
   - Since both \( x \) and \( y \) are less than or equal to \( 0xFFFF \), their product \( x \times y \) will always be less than or equal to \( 0xFFFF \times 0xFFFF \).
   - From step 3, we have:
     \[
     0xFFFF \times 0xFFFF = 4,294,836,225 < 2^{32}
     \]
   - Therefore, for any 16-bit unsigned integers \( x \) and \( y \):
     \[
     x \times y \leq 0xFFFF \times 0xFFFF < 2^{32}
     \]
     \[
     \Rightarrow x \times y < 2^{32}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Thus, the product \( x \times y \) of two 16-bit unsigned integers will always be less than \( 2^{32} \).

This completes the proof.
