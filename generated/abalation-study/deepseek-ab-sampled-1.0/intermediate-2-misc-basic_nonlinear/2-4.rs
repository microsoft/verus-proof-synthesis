To prove that for all `x` and `y` satisfying `x ≤ 0xffff` and `y ≤ 0xffff`, their product `x * y` satisfies `x * y ≤ 0x100000000`, we can proceed as follows:

**Proof:**

1. **Understanding the Constraints:**
   - Given `x` and `y` are both `u32` (32-bit unsigned integers).
   - The constraints `x ≤ 0xffff` and `y ≤ 0xffff` imply that both `x` and `y` are at most `65535` (since `0xffff` in hexadecimal equals `65535` in decimal).

2. **Maximum Value Consideration:**
   - The maximum value for both `x` and `y` under these constraints is `65535`.
   - Calculating the product of these maximum values:
     \[
     65535 \times 65535 = (2^{16} - 1) \times (2^{16} - 1) = 2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1 = 4,294,967,296 - 131,072 + 1 = 4,294,836,225
     \]
   - Notably, `4,294,836,225` is slightly less than `4,294,967,296` (which is `2^{32}`).

3. **General Product Calculation:**
   - For any `x` and `y` where `x ≤ 65535` and `y ≤ 65535`, their product `x * y` will be less than or equal to the product of their maximum values:
     \[
     x * y ≤ 65535 \times 65535 = 4,294,836,225
     \]
   - Since `4,294,836,225 < 4,294,967,296`, it follows that:
     \[
     x * y < 2^{32}
     \]
   - Thus:
     \[
     x * y ≤ 0x100000000
     \]
     This is because `0x100000000` is equivalent to `2^{32}`.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Under the given constraints, the product `x * y` cannot exceed `0x100000000`.
   - Therefore, for all `x`, `y` satisfying `x ≤ 0xffff` and `y ≤ 0xffff`, the inequality `x * y ≤ 0x100000000` holds true.

This completes the proof that the product of `x` and `y` under the specified conditions does not exceed `0x100000000`.
