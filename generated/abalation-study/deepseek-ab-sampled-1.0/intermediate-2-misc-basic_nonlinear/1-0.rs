Here's the step-by-step explanation and proof:

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to prove that for two unsigned 32-bit integers, \( x \) and \( y \), if \( x \leq 0xFFFF \) and \( y \leq 0xFFFF \) (i.e., both are 16-bit unsigned integers), then their product \( x \times y \) satisfies \( x \times y \leq 0x100000000 \).

**Step 2: Express Values in Decimal for Clarity**

- \( 0xFFFF \) in decimal is \( 65535 \).
- \( 0x100000000 \) in decimal is \( 4294967296 \).

We need to show:
\[ \text{If } x \leq 65535 \text{ and } y \leq 65535, \text{ then } x \times y \leq 4294967296 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the Maximum Possible Product**

The maximum values \( x \) and \( y \) can each take are \( 65535 \).

\[ \text{Maximum product} = 65535 \times 65535 \]

Calculating this:

\[ 65535 \times 65535 = 4294836225 \]

**Step 4: Compare the Maximum Product to \( 0x100000000 \)**

- The calculated maximum product is \( 4294836225 \).
- \( 0x100000000 \) is \( 4294967296 \).

Since \( 4294836225 < 4294967296 \), it follows that:

\[ 65535 \times 65535 < 0x100000000 \]

**Step 5: Generalize the Result**

For any \( x \) and \( y \) where:
\[ 0 \leq x \leq 65535 \]
\[ 0 \leq y \leq 65535 \]

The product \( x \times y \) must be less than or equal to \( 65535 \times 65535 \), which we've already established is less than \( 0x100000000 \).

**Step 6: Mathematical Representation**

Express \( x \) and \( y \) as:
\[ x \leq 2^{16} - 1 \]
\[ y \leq 2^{16} - 1 \]

Multiplying both:
\[ x \times y \leq (2^{16} - 1) \times (2^{16} - 1) \]

\[ = 2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1 \]

Note that \( 2^{32} = 4294967296 \) and \( 2^{32} - 2^{17} + 1 < 2^{32} \).

Thus:
\[ x \times y < 2^{32} \]
\[ x \times y < 0x100000000 \]

**Step 7: Conclusion**

Therefore, given \( x \leq 0xFFFF \) and \( y \leq 0xFFFF \), their product \( x \times y \) is guaranteed to be less than or equal to \( 0x100000000 \), ensuring no overflow beyond a 32-bit unsigned integer limit.
