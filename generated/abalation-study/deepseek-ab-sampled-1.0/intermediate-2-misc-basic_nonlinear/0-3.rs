To prove that \( x \times y \leq 2^{32} \) given that \( x \) and \( y \) are 16-bit unsigned integers (i.e., \( 0 \leq x, y \leq 0xFFFF \)), we can proceed as follows:

**Step 1: Understand the Range of Values**

A 16-bit unsigned integer can hold values from 0 to 65535 (inclusive). Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
\[ 0 \leq x, y \leq 65535 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the Maximum Possible Product**

The maximum product of two 16-bit numbers occurs when both \( x \) and \( y \) are at their maximum value:
\[ \text{Maximum Product} = 65535 \times 65535 \]

Calculating this:
\[ 65535 \times 65535 = 4,294,836,225 \]

**Step 3: Compare the Maximum Product to \( 2^{32} \)**

\( 2^{32} \) is equal to 4,294,967,296. Comparing this to the maximum product:
\[ 4,294,836,225 < 4,294,967,296 \]

**Step 4: Conclude the Proof**

Since the maximum possible product of two 16-bit unsigned integers is less than \( 2^{32} \), it follows that for all values of \( x \) and \( y \) within the 16-bit range:
\[ x \times y < 2^{32} \]
\[ \Rightarrow x \times y \leq 2^{32} \]

Therefore, the function `bound_check` satisfies the post-condition \( x \times y \leq 0x100000000 \) whenever \( x \) and \( y \) are valid 16-bit unsigned integers.
