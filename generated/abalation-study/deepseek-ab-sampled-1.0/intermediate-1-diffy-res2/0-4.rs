To add loop invariants to the given Rust function so that Verus can verify the function's behavior, we need to ensure that each loop maintains certain properties throughout its execution. These invariants will help in proving that the function adheres to the specified ensures clause.

Here is the Rust code with the necessary loop invariants added:

rust
use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}
verus!{

pub fn myfun(a: &mut Vec<i32>, b: &mut Vec<i32>, c: &mut Vec<i32>, sum: &mut Vec<i32>, N: i32)
    requires
        N > 0,
        old(a).len() == N,
        old(b).len() == N,
        old(c).len() == N,
        old(sum).len() == 1,
        N < 1000,
    ensures
        sum[0] <= 3 * N,
{
    sum.set(0, 0);
    let mut i: usize = 0;

    // Loop 1: Initialize vector a to 1s
    while (i < N as usize)
        invariant
            // Ensure i does not exceed N
            i <= N as usize,
            // Check lengths of a, b, c, and sum
            a.len() == N as usize,
            b.len() == N as usize,
            c.len() == N as usize,
            sum.len() == 1,
            // Ensure that values in a up to i are 1
            for |j: usize| 0 <= j < i ==> a[j] == 1,

    i = 0;

            sum[0] == i as i32,

        i = i + 1;

    i = 0;

    while (i < N as usize)
        invariant
            // Ensure i does not exceed N
            i <= N as usize,
            // Ensure length of b is N
            b.len() == N as usize,
            // All elements in b up to i are 1
            for |j: usize| 0 <= j < i ==> b[j] == 1,
    {
        b.set(i, 1);
        i = i + 1;
    }

    i = 0;
