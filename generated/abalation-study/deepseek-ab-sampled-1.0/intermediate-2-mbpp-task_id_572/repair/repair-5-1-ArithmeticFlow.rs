To fix the arithmetic overflow concern in the given Rust code using Verus, we'll add an assertion before the `counter += 1;` line to ensure the increment doesn't exceed the maximum possible value dictated by the recursive function `count_frequency_rcr`. We'll also create a lemma function to prove the monotonicity of `count_frequency_rcr` to assist in this proof.

**Step-by-Step Explanation and Solution:**

1. **Identify the Issue in the Code:**
   - The line `counter += 1;` in the `count_frequency` function could potentially cause an overflow if `counter` reaches the maximum value of `usize` (`usize::MAX`).
   - Since `counter` is incremented each time the key is found in the array, the number of increments is equal to the number of occurrences of the key in the array.

2. **Understand the Impact of the Recursive Function:**
   - The recursive function `count_frequency_rcr` counts how many times `key` appears in the sequence.
   - It's crucial that this function doesn't return a value larger than `usize::MAX`, which could cause overflow when assigned to `counter`.

3. **Create a Lemma Function for Monotonicity:**
   - We'll create a lemma function `lemma_monotonic` that proves `count_frequency_rcr` is non-decreasing with respect to the sequence length. This means that as the sequence length increases, the count of the key doesn't decrease.
   - This lemma will help in asserting that the increment of `counter` won't cause overflow because the recursive function's result is bounded by the array's length.

4. **Implement the Lemma Function:**
   - The lemma function will take two indices, `i` and `j`, ensuring `i <= j` and using induction to prove that `count_frequency_rcr` at `i` is less than or equal to `count_frequency_rcr` at `j`.

5. **Add the Assertion Before Incrementing `counter`:**
   - Before the line `counter += 1;`, we'll add an assertion that `counter + 1` doesn't exceed the maximum value allowed by the `count_frequency_rcr` function for the remainder of the array.
   - This assertion will use the lemma function to support the

//             counter += 1;
//   None: counter += 1

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 67
// Safe: False
