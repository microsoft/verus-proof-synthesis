Okay, so I have this Rust code that's failing a post-condition in Verus. The error message says that the post-condition on lines 35-38 is not being satisfied, and it's failing at the end of the function body, specifically where the function returns the result.

Let me look at the code to understand what's going on. The function in question is find_dissimilar, which takes two vectors, arr1 and arr2, and returns a new vector containing elements that are in one array but not the other. It also ensures that all elements in the result are unique.

The post-conditions are:
1. For every element in arr1, if it's not in arr2, then it should be in the result.
2. Similarly, for every element in arr2, if it's not in arr1, then it should be in the result.
3. All elements in the result must be unique.

The function uses two loops. The first loop iterates through arr1 and adds elements to the result if they are not in arr2 and not already in the result. The second loop does the same for arr2.

The error occurs at the end of the function, which suggests that the result vector does not meet the post-conditions after both loops have completed.

Now, looking at the ensure clauses, there's a forall condition that checks for each element in arr2. If an element is not in arr1, it must be in the result. The error suggests that this condition is not being met.

Wait, looking at the code, in the first loop, it iterates over arr1 and adds elements to the result if they are not in arr2 and not already in the result. Then, in the second loop, it does the same for arr2.

But perhaps there's an issue with how the loops are structured or how the conditions are checked. Maybe some elements are not being added correctly because of the order of operations or because of duplicate checks.

Let me think about this step by step:

1. The first loop processes arr1. For each element in arr1:
   - It checks if the element is not in arr2.
   - It also checks if the element is not already in the result.
   - If both conditions are met, it adds the element to the result.

2. The second loop processes arr2. For each element in arr2:
   - It checks if the element is not in arr1.
   - It also checks if the element is not already in the result.
   - If both conditions are met, it adds the element to the result.

But wait, after the first loop, the result vector already contains some elements. When processing arr2, if an element from arr2 is not in arr1, but is already in the result (from arr1), it shouldn't be added again. That seems correct.

However, the post-condition is failing for elements in arr2 that are not in arr1. It seems that some of these elements are not making it into the result vector.

Maybe there's a problem in how the contains function is being used. The contains function checks if an element exists in a vector by iterating through it. But in the ensure clause, it's using the contains function with arr1 and arr2, which are the original vectors.

Wait, but in the ensures clause for the second part, it's checking for elements in arr2 that are not in arr1. So, if during the second loop, while processing arr2, an element is not in arr1 and not already in the result, it's added. That should satisfy the ensure clause.

Is there a possibility that during the second loop, an element from arr2 is not being added to the result because it's already in the result, but it's actually supposed to be there?

But according to the ensure clause, the element should be in the result if it's not in arr1. So, if the element is not in arr1, it should be in the result, regardless of whether it's already there. Wait, no. Because in the ensure clause, it's only adding if it's not in arr1 and not in the result already. So if it's not in arr1 and it's already in the result, it doesn't need to be added again.

But the error suggests that for some i in arr2, the element arr2[i] is not in arr1, but it's not in the result either. That would violate the ensure clause.

So why is that happening? Maybe during the second loop, the element arr2[i] is not being added to the result because it's already in arr1, but actually, it's supposed to be in the result because it's not in arr1.

Wait, that seems contradictory. Let me re-express this.

In the second loop, for each element arr2[i]:
- If arr2[i] is not in arr1, then it should be in the result.
- Additionally, if arr2[i] is not already in the result, it should be added.

Wait, no, the condition is if arr2[i] is not in arr1 and not already in the result, then add it.

But the ensure clause says that if arr2[i] is not in arr1, then it should be in the result. So, regardless of how it's added, as long as arr2[i] is not in arr1, it should end up in the result.

In the current code, during the second loop, we check if arr2[i] is not in arr1 and not in the result. If both are true, we add it to the result. But if it's not in arr1 but it is already in the result (maybe added during the first loop due to another reason), then it's not added again.

But the first loop only adds elements from arr1 to the result. So, an element from arr2 could have been added in the first loop if it's not in arr2. Wait, no, the first loop is about checking elements in arr1 not present in arr2.

Wait, that's confusing. Let's clarify:

- The first loop is for elements in arr1 that are not in arr2.
- The second loop is for elements in arr2 that are not in arr1.

So, during the first loop, if an element is in arr1 but not in arr2, it's added to the result. In the second loop, if an element is in arr2 but not in arr1, it's added to the result.

But suppose that during the first loop, an element is added to the result that is in arr1 but also in arr2. That's not possible because during the first loop, it's only added if it's not in arr2.

Wait, no. The first loop adds an element from arr1 to the result if it's not in arr2 and not already in the result.

So, during the second loop, when processing elements in arr2 that are not in arr1, the code adds them to the result if they are not already present.

But perhaps, during the second loop, the condition is wrong. Let's look at what's in the code:

In the second loop, the condition is:
if (!contains(arr1, arr2[index]) && !contains(&result, arr2[index])) {
    result.push(arr2[index]);
}

So, for each element in arr2, if it's not in arr1 and not already in the result, it's added.

But according to the ensure clause, any element in arr2 that's not in arr1 must be in the result, regardless of whether it's already there. But the current code only adds it if it's not already there.

Wait, that's a problem. Because if the element was added in the first loop (which it shouldn't be, because in the first loop, we're adding elements from arr1 that are not in arr2), but if for some reason the same value is in both arr1 and arr2, but not in the other, it's possible that theCondition might not add it in the second loop.

But the ensure clause requires that all elements in arr2 not present in arr1 are in the result. So, the current code's condition is too restrictive. It shouldn't check whether the element is already in the result, because the ensure clause allows for duplicates, but in the function, the result is supposed to contain each such element exactly once.

Wait, no. The function has an ensure clause that says that for any element in arr2 that's not in arr1, it must be in the result, and the result has unique elements.

So, if during the first loop, an element from arr1 that's not in arr2 is added to the result, and during the second loop, an element from arr2 that's not in arr1 is also added, but perhaps there's a case where an element from arr2 is not in arr1 but is already in the result, so it's not added, but according to the ensure clause, it must be in the result.

So, perhaps the code should add the element from arr2 to the result if it's not in arr1, regardless of whether it's already in the result. But that would create duplicates, which are not allowed due to the ensure clause that requires all elements in the result to be unique.

Wait, that's conflicting.

Alternatively, perhaps the issue is that the second loop is not correctly capturing all elements in arr2 that are not in arr1, because the condition is more restrictive than needed.

Wait, perhaps the issue is that the code checks whether the element is not in arr1 and not in the result. But if the element is not in arr1, but is in the result (for example, added from arr1), it's not added again, but according to the ensure clause, it must be in the result. So perhaps the condition should be adjusted.

Wait, no, the first loop only adds elements from arr1 that are not in arr2. So, an element in arr2 that's not in arr1 would not be in the result after the first loop. So during the second loop, when processing such an element, since it's not in arr1 and not in the result, it's added. So that seems correct.

But perhaps the issue is that during the first loop, the contains function is called with arr2, but arr2 may have elements that are not in arr1, but the first loop's condition is checking if the element from arr1 is not in arr2.

So, for example, suppose arr1 has an element that is present in arr1 but not in arr2, so it's added to the result. Then, during the second loop, an element in arr2 is not in arr1, so it's added if not already in the result.

But in the current error, the post-condition is failing for an element in arr2 that's not in arr1. So, it must not have been added to the result.

So why would that be the case? Perhaps because during the second loop, the element was checked and not added, perhaps because of a condition.

Wait, looking back at the code, the second loop is:

while index < arr2.len()
    invariant
        0 <= index <= arr2.len(),
        0 <= arr2.len(),
        result.len() <= index + arr1.len(),
        forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < result.len() ==> result[i] != result[j],
{
    if (!contains(arr1, arr2[index]) && !contains(&result, arr2[index])) {
        result.push(arr2[index]);
    }
    index += 1;
}

So, it's checking if the element is not in arr1 and not in result before adding it.

If the element is not in arr1, but is in result (from the first loop), then it's not added. But according to the ensure clause, it should be in the result. So, perhaps the condition should be adjusted.

But wait, if the element is in result from the first loop, that must mean that it was in arr1, but since we're processing an element from arr2 that's not in arr1, that can't be. Because in the first loop, we're only adding elements from arr1 that are not in arr2.

Wait, that's a contradiction. So, if the element is in arr2 but not in arr1, the first loop wouldn't have added it to result, because the first loop checks if the element from arr1 is not in arr2 before adding it. So, during the second loop, when processing an element from arr2 that's not in arr1, the element wouldn't be in the result, so the condition !contains(&result, arr2[index]) would be true, and the element should be added.

But according to the ensure clause, that's not happening, which suggests that during the second loop, the element is not being added, implying that one of the conditions is not met.

Alternatively, perhaps the contains function is not correctly determining whether the element is in arr1. Maybe the contains function has an issue.

Looking at the contains function:

fn contains(arr: &Vec<i32>, key: i32) -> (result: bool)
    ensures
        result == (exists|i: int| 0 <= i < arr.len() && (arr[i] == key)),
{
    let mut index = 0;
    while index < arr.len()
        invariant
            0 <= index <= arr.len(),
            0 <= arr.len(),
    {
        if (arr[index] == key) {
            return true;
        }
        index += 1;
    }
    false
}

This seems correct. It iterates through the array, returns true if the key is found, false otherwise.

So, the issue must be elsewhere.

Perhaps, during the second loop, the condition is too restrictive. For example, if the element is in arr2, not in arr1, but it's already in the result (from the first loop), which shouldn't happen.

Wait, that can't happen because the first loop adds elements from arr1 that are not in arr2. So, if an element is in arr2 and not in arr1, it shouldn't be added during the first loop.

But maybe, due to duplicates in arr1 or arr2, this isn't being handled correctly.

Alternatively, perhaps the loop is structured in such a way that some elements are being skipped.

Another possibility is that the invariants are not properly maintaining the state, causing the result vector to not include all necessary elements.

Looking at the invariants for the loops:

For the first loop:

invariant
    0 <= index <= arr1.len(),
    0 <= arr1.len(),
    result.len() <= index,
    forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < result.len() ==> result[i] != result[j],
{
    if (!contains(arr2, arr1[index]) && !contains(&result, arr1[index])) {
        result.push(arr1[index]);
    }
    index += 1;
}

So, for each step, it's ensuring that the result's length doesn't exceed the current index, and that all elements in the result are unique.

In the second loop:

invariant
    0 <= index <= arr2.len(),
    0 <= arr2.len(),
    result.len() <= index + arr1.len(),
    forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < result.len() ==> result[i] != result[j],
{
    if (!contains(arr1, arr2[index]) && !contains(&result, arr2[index])) {
        result.push(arr2[index]);
    }
    index += 1;
}

Similar invariants but allowing for a larger possible result length.

Wait, perhaps the invariant in the second loop is too restrictive. Specifically, result.len() <= index + arr1.len(). If arr1.len() is large, this might allow the result to be too long, but the function's ensure clause requires that all elements in the result are unique, which is maintained.

But I'm not sure if that's directly causing the issue.

Alternatively, perhaps the problem is that in the second loop, the code is adding to the result even if the element is already in the result, but due to the invariant, it's not allowed. But the invariant enforces that all elements in the result are unique.

Wait, the code in the second loop checks if the element is not in the result before adding it, so duplicates should not occur.

But according to the error, for some i, arr2[i] is not in arr1, but it's not in the result. So the function is returning a result that doesn't satisfy the ensure clause.

So, perhaps the code is correctly adding the necessary elements, but the invariants or other conditions are not properly being maintained, causing the ensure clause to fail.

Another angle: maybe the ensures clause is not correctly capturing the necessary conditions because of how it's structured.

Looking at the ensures clause for find_dissimilar:

forall|i: int|
    0 <= i < arr1.len() ==> (!arr2@.contains(# [trigger] arr1[i]) ==> result@.contains(
        arr1[i],
    )),
forall|i: int|
    0 <= i < arr2.len() ==> (!arr1@.contains(# [trigger] arr2[i]) ==> result@.contains(
        arr2[i],
    )),
forall|i: int, j: int|
    0 <= i < j < result.len() ==> # [trigger] result[i] != # [trigger] result[j],

So, for each element in arr1, if it's not in arr2, it must be in the result. For each element in arr2, if it's not in arr1, it must be in the result. And all elements in the result are unique.

Perhaps the issue is that the function's logic is adding elements to the result in a way that doesn't cover all possible cases, or that the conditions in the loops are not capturing all necessary elements.

Wait, perhaps the problem is that during the second loop, the index starts at 0 again, which could cause elements to be skipped or processed incorrectly if the vector has certain properties.

Alternatively, maybe the initial value of result is empty, and during the first loop, some elements are added, but during the second loop, some are missed.

Alternatively, perhaps the way the function handles duplicates is causing issues.

Let me think of an example.

Suppose arr1 = [1, 2, 3], arr2 = [4, 5, 6]. Then the result should be [1,2,3,4,5,6].

Another example: arr1 = [1, 2], arr2 = [2, 3]. Then, the elements in arr1 not in arr2 are 1. The elements in arr2 not in arr1 are 3. So the result should be [1,3].

Another case: arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4], arr2 = [3,4,5,6]. So, the elements in arr1 not in arr2 are 1,2. The elements in arr2 not in arr1 are 5,6. So the result should be [1,2,5,6].

Wait, according to the function, the first loop adds elements from arr1 not in arr2, which are 1,2. The second loop adds elements from arr2 not in arr1, which are5,6. So the
