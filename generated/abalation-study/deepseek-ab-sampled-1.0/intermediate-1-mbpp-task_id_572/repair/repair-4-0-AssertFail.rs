To resolve the assertion failure in your Rust code, you can make use of the `reveal(Seq::filter);` directive in Verus. This directive helps the verifier understand the underlying implementation of the `filter` method on sequences, which in turn enables it to prove the assertion about the `unique_arr` correctly matching the filtered sequence.

**Here's how you can modify the code:**

1. **Add `reveal(Seq::filter);` at the beginning of the `remove_duplicates` function**:
   
   This step is crucial because it instructs the Verus verifier to expand the `filter` method call, revealing its internal operations. By doing so, the verifier can better comprehend the structure and expected outcomes of the `filter` operation, which is essential for proving the assertion.

2. **Ensure the correctness of other components**:
   
   Although the primary issue addressed here is the assertion in `remove_duplicates`, it's important to confirm that all other parts of the code, such as the `count_frequency` and `count_frequency_rcr` functions, are correctly implemented and consistent. This includes ensuring that loop invariants and postconditions accurately reflect the intended behavior of the code.

**Step-by-Step Explanation**:

- **Revealing the Filter Operation**:
  - By adding `reveal(Seq::filter);` at the start of `remove_duplicates`, you equip Verus with the necessary information about how the `filter` method operates on sequences. This allows the verifier to validate the assertion by comparing `unique_arr@` directly with the filtered sequence.

- **Understanding the Assertion**:
  - The assertion `unique_arr@ == arr@.filter(|x: i32| count_frequency_rcr(arr@, x) == 1)` checks if `unique_arr` contains exactly those elements of `arr@` whose frequency in `arr@` is 1. The `filter` method constructs such a sequence.
  - The failure occurs if Verus cannot confirm this equality, often due to insufficient information about the `filter` method's implementation.

- **How the Reveal Directive Helps**:
  - The reveal directive ensures that Verus expands the `filter` method, providing a detailed view of how elements are included or excluded based on the provided condition. This helps the verifier to align its proof strategy with the actual sequence construction.

- **Verifying Other Components**:
  - While adjusting the `remove_duplicates` function, cross-verify that `count_frequency` accurately counts occurrences and that `count_frequency_rcr` correctly specifies the count. Any discrepancies in these functions could lead to incorrect filtering and failing assertions.

**Modified Code**:

        }
    }

fn count_freq(arr: &Vec<i32>, key: i32) -> (frequency: usize)

        count_frequency_rcr(arr@, key) == frequency,

    {

            counter += 1;

fn remove_duplicates(arr: &Vec<i32>) -> (unique_arr: Vec<i32>)
    ensures
        unique_arr@ == arr@.filter(|x: i32| count_frequency_rcr(arr@, x) == 1),
{
    reveal(Seq::filter);
    let mut unique_arr: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
