assert(sum as i128 + arr[index] as i128 <= i128::max()) by {
    // Use arithmetic tactics to prove the upper bound.
    // Assuming `add` tactic is available for addition properties.
    // If necessary, provide additional proofs or lemmas here.
};

However, looking back, since the code uses `arr[index] as i128`, and `sum` is already an `i128`, we need to ensure that the sum does not exceed `i128::max()` or go below `i128::min()`.

Given that `sum` starts at 0 and increments are added, to prevent overflow, we will ensure that:

rust
assert(sum + (arr[index] as i128) <= i128::max()) by {
    // Use arithmetic properties to prove
};

Similarly, to prevent underflow (though less likely when adding), we might also check:

rust
assert(sum + (arr[index] as i128) >= i128::min()) by {
    // Use arithmetic properties to prove
};

But given the initial code, ensuring the upper bound is sufficient for preventing overflow.

Implementing this, the updated code becomes:

rust
use vstd::prelude::*;

fn main() {}
verus! {

#[verifier::loop_isolation(false)]

spec fn sum_to(arr: Seq<i64>) -> int
    decreases arr.len(),
{
    if arr.len() == 0 {
        0
    } else {
        sum_to(arr.drop_last()) + arr.last()
    }
}

fn sum(arr: &Vec<i64>) -> (sum: i128)
    ensures
        sum_to(arr@) == sum,
{
    let mut index = 0;
    let mut sum = 0i128;
    while index < arr.len()
        invariant
            index <= arr.len(),
            sum == sum_to(arr@.take(index as int)),
            index >= 0,
            arr.len() >= 0,
    {
        // Add assertion here to prevent overflow
        assert(sum + (arr[index] as i128) <= i128::max(), "Sum would overflow i128");
        
        sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
        index += 1;
    }
    sum
}

}


//         sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
//   None: sum + arr[index] as i128

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 13
