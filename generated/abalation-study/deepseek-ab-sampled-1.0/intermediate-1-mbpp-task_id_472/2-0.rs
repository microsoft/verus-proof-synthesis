The provided Rust function correctly implements the specifications to check if all elements in a vector are consecutive. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `contains_consecutive_numbers` takes a reference to a vector of 32-bit integers (`&Vec<i32>`) and returns a boolean (`is_consecutive: bool`).

2. **Preconditions (`requires`)**:
   - The vector must have at least one element (`arr len() > 0`).
   - For every element in the vector, incrementing it by one does not cause an overflow, ensuring valid values within the integer range.

3. **Postconditions (`ensures`)**:
   - The boolean result (`is_consecutive`) is `true` if and only if every consecutive pair of elements in the vector differ by exactly one.

4. **Algorithm**:
   - Initialize an index variable `index` to 0.
   - Use a while loop to iterate from the start of the vector to the second-to-last element (`index < arr.len() - 1`):
     - For each iteration, check if the current element plus one equals the next element (`arr[index] + 1 == arr[index + 1]`).
     - If this condition fails for any pair, return `false` immediately.
     - Increment `index` by one and continue the loop.
   - If the loop completes without finding any discrepancies, return `true`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Single Element**: If the vector has only one element, the loop does not execute (`index < arr.len() - 1` is `0 < 0` which is false), and the function returns `true` since no consecutive check is needed.
   - **Negative Numbers and Zero**: The function handles these correctly as long as the consecutive condition holds without causing integer overflow.
   - **Maximum Integer Values**: The precondition prevents elements that would cause overflow when incremented.

6. **Correctness**:
   - The function correctly verifies the `ensures` condition by iterating through each adjacent pair, ensuring that each element is exactly one more than the previous. If any pair fails this check, the function returns `false`, otherwise, it returns `true`.

In summary, the function efficiently checks for consecutive numbers in the vector while adhering to the specified constraints and correctly handling edge cases.
