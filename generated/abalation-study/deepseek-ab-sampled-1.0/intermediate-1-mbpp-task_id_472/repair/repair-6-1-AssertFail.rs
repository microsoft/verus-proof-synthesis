To fix the assertion error, we need to ensure that the loop invariant correctly enforces the condition that `i` remains greater than or equal to 2. Here's the corrected code:

use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}

verus! {

fn while_loop(n: usize) 
    requires
        n >= 2,
{
    let mut i = 2;
    while i < n 
        invariant
            i <= n,
            n >= 2,
            i >= 2, // Ensure `i` is at least 2
    {
        assert(i >= 2);
        i += 1;
    }
}

}

**Explanation:**
1. **Loop Invariant Update:** Added `i >= 2` to the loop invariant to ensure that `i` is always at least 2.
2. **Assertion Holds:** This modification guarantees that the assertion `assert(i >= 2);` will always be true within the loop.

This adjustment formally ensures that `i` remains within the required bounds, resolving the assertion failure.

//         assert(forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < arr.len() && j == i + 1 ==> arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]); // Added by AI
//   assertion failed: forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < arr.len() && j == i + 1 ==> arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 12
// Safe: False
