Alright, so I've been given this Rust code that’s supposed to cube each element of a vector. I need to add loop invariants so that Verus can verify that the function does what it's supposed to do. I'm still getting the hang of this, but I'll try to break it down step by step.

First, let me look at the function. It’s called `cube_element` and it takes a reference to a `Vec<i32>` and returns a new `Vec<i32>` where each element is the cube of the corresponding element in the input vector. The code initializes an empty vector `cubed_array` and then loops over each element, pushing the cube into `cubed_array`.

Okay, so the loop is pretty straightforward. The initial code doesn’t have any invariants, which is what I need to add. From what I understand, invariants are properties that hold true before and after each iteration of the loop. They help Verus understand what’s happening inside the loop and ensure that the function behaves correctly.

So, looking at the loop, I see that `i` starts at 0 and increments by 1 each time until it’s less than `nums.len()`. In each iteration, it pushes the cube of `nums[i]` into `cubed_array`. Since `cubed_aray` is initially empty, the first element is at index 0, then index 1, and so on.

Now, I need to think about what properties should hold true at each step. Remember, the goal is to ensure that after the loop, `cubed_array` contains the cubes of all elements in `nums`.

Let me list out the variables involved:
- `cubed_array`: the output vector being built.
- `i`: the loop counter.
- `nums`: the input vector.

In the first loop iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- `cubed_array` is empty.
- The loop condition is checked: `i < nums.len()`.
- Inside the loop, `nums[0]` is cubed and pushed into `cubed_array`.

After this, `cubed_array` has one element, which is the cube of `nums[0]`.

In the next iteration:
- `i` is 1.
- `cubed_array` has one element.
- The loop condition is checked again.
- `nums[1]` is cubed and pushed into `cubed_array`.

After that, `cubed_array` has two elements, the cubes of `nums[0]` and `nums[1]`.

This pattern continues until `i` reaches `nums.len()`, at which point the loop exits.

So, an invariant must capture what’s true at each step of the loop. Ideally, it should express that the first `i` elements of `cubed_array` are the cubes of the first `i` elements of `nums`.

Wait, but before any loop iterations, `i` is 0, and `cubed_array` is empty. At that point, does zero elements being processed make sense? I guess it does; it’s like saying "so far, zero elements have been processed."

Now, after each iteration:
- `i` increases by 1.
- `cubed_array` gains one more element.

So, after `i` iterations, `cubed_array` should have `i` elements, each being the cube of the corresponding element in `nums`.

But also, before each iteration, `i` should be less than the length of `nums`, right? Because if `i` is equal to `nums.len()`, the loop shouldn’t execute.

So, possible invariants:
1. `i` is a valid index for `nums`.
2. The length of `cubed_array` is equal to `i`.
3. For every index `k < i`, `cubed_array[k]` equals `nums[k]` cubed.

These seem reasonable. The first invariant ensures that we’re not accessing out-of-bounds elements in `nums`. The second ensures that the size of `cubed_array` reflects how many elements have been processed. The third ensures that what’s been processed so far is correct.

Let me see how to express these in code. In Rust, within a loop, you can define an `invariant` block. So, within the loop, before the push, I can have an `invariant` block that lists these properties.

Also, considering the spec, I need to make sure that the invariants tie back to the function's ensures clause, which says that every element in `cubed_arary` is the cube of the corresponding element in `nums`.

So, the loop invariants should establish a partial correctness that, when combined with the loop's progress, leads to the overall ensures condition.

Another thing to consider is that the invariants should hold true both before and after each loop iteration. That is, they should be maintained throughout the loop.

Let me think about the progression of `i`:

At the start of the loop, `i=0`, and `cubed_array` is empty. The invariants would assert that for `i=0`, `cubed_array` has length 0, and the loop body is about to process `i=0`.

After processing, `i` becomes 1, and `cubed_array` has one element.

In the next iteration, `i=1`, and the invariants would assert that the first element of `cubed_array` is the cube of `nums[0]`, and that the size of `cubed_array` is 1.

This seems consistent.

But how do I express these invariants in Rust? From the example, I see that invariants are added inside the loop block, typically after the code that modifies the loop variables but before the loop's update step.

So, after pushing the new element into `cubed_array`, I can have the invariant block.

Let me sketch this out:

while (i < nums.len()) {

    cubed_array.push(nums[i] * nums[i] * nums[i]);
    i += 1;

    invariant
        0 <= i <= nums.len(),
        cubed_array.len() == i,
        ∀k: int, 0 <= k < i: cubed_array[k] == nums[k] * nums[k] * nums[k],
}

Wait, but it's important to note the order of operations. The invariant should be after the push and increment because the invariant should describe the state after the iteration.

Also, the trigger for the for loop is important. Verus needs to know where to look for the state changes that affect the invariants.

Hmm, so putting the invariant after the push and increment seems correct.

Now, I need to translate this into Rust syntax. Verus uses `invariant` blocks, and within those, you can list the properties that are expected to hold.

So, within the loop:

cubed_array.push(nums[i] * nums[i] * nums[i]);
i += 1;

invariant {
    // properties go here
}

Now, in terms of the properties:

1. `i <= nums.len()` because after incrementing, `i` could be equal to `nums.len()`.

2. `cubed_array.len() == i` because after the push, the length increased by 1, and `i` was incremented as well.

3. For all `k < i`, `cubed_array[k] == nums[k] * nums[k] * nums[k]`.

But in the syntax, I need to express this in terms of spec functions and proof functions, I think.

I think within the invariant, I can express these conditions directly.

Putting it all together, the loop with invariants would look like:

while (i < nums.len()) {
    cubed_array.push(nums[i] * nums[i] * nums[i]);
    i += 1;

    invariant {
        i <= nums.len();
        cubed_array.len() == i;
        forall(|k: int| {
            implies(
                0 <= k < i,
                cubed_array[k] == nums[k] * nums[k] * nums[k]
            )
        });
    }
}

This seems reasonable.

Now, I also need to add the initial condition that at the start of the loop, the invariants hold. So, before the loop, I might need to have an `assert` statement that the invariants hold for `i=0`.

But looking back at the example, often the invariants are established in the initial step and maintained in each iteration. So, for `i=0`, the invariants would assert that `cubed_array` is empty (`i=0`), which it is initially.

So, putting it all together, the function with the invariants would look like:

fn cube_element(nums: &Vec<i32>) -> (cubed: Vec<i32>)
    requires
        forall|k: int|
            0 <= k < nums.len() ==> (i32::MIN <= #[trigger] nums[k] * #[trigger] nums[k] <= i32::MAX),
        forall|k: int|
            0 <= k < nums.len() ==> (i32::MIN <= #[trigger] nums[k] * #[trigger] nums[k] * #[trigger] nums[k] <= i32::MAX),
    ensures
        forall|i: int|
            0 <= i < nums.len() ==> cubed[i] == #[trigger] nums[i] * #[trigger] nums[i] * #[trigger] nums[i],
{
    let mut cubed_array: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    let mut i = 
// is safe: False
// Score: Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 192
