   sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
   
2. **Add the Assertion**: Before this update, we'll assert that the new sum won't exceed the bounds of `i128`. However, since `i128` can handle very large values, we need to consider how the elements are bounded and how many elements we're adding.

3. **Use Loop Invariants**: The loop invariants already contain some constraints about the array elements. We can use these to bound the possible sums and avoid overflow.

4. **Create a Lemma for Monotonicity (if applicable)**: In this case, since the sum increases by each element's value, a monotonicity lemma could help, but due to `i64` elements potentially being negative, it's more complex. Instead, we'll directly assert based on the element value and the current sum.

Here's the updated code with the assertion added:

rust
use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}
verus! {

#[verifier::loop_isolation(false)]

spec fn sum_to(arr: Seq<i64>) -> int
    decreases arr.len(),
{
    if arr.len() == 0 {
        0
    } else {
        sum_to(arr.drop_last()) + arr.last()
    }
}

fn sum(arr: &Vec<i64>) -> (sum: i128)
    ensures
        sum_to(arr@) == sum,
{
    let mut index = 0;
    let mut sum = 0i128;
    while index < arr.len()
        invariant
            0 <= index <= arr.len(),
            index <= arr.len(),
            sum == sum_to(arr@.take(index as int)),
            forall |k: int| 0<= k < index ==> arr[k] >= -9223372036854775808,
            forall |k: int| 0<= k < index ==> arr[k] <= 9223372036854775807,
    {
        // Assert that adding the next element won't cause overflow
        assert !(sum > i128::MAX - (arr[index] as i128) ) by
            // This would prevent an overflow if we're adding a positive value
            // The loop invariants ensure that arr[index] does not exceed i64's bounds
            {}
        sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
        index += 1;
    }
    sum
}

} // verus!


//         sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
//   None: sum + arr[index] as i128
