The issue here involves the loop invariant specified for the consecutive numbers check. The invariant:

forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]),

This statement tries to assure that for all pairs of indices `i` and `j` in the array where `0 <= i < j <= index + 1` and `j < arr.len()`, the element at `i` is exactly one less than the element at `j`. However, this invariant does not hold at the beginning of the loop (when `index = 0`), because it implies that every pair of elements up to `index + 1` must follow the `arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]` rule before the loop even starts iterating, which cannot be guaranteed without an initial check or specific conditions.

To correct this, let's adjust the invariant to reflect the actual intention: ensuring that each element is consecutively one less than its immediate next neighbor, up to the current index. Therefore, the correct invariant just before entering the loop should focus on the elements iterated so far, ensuring they are consecutive up to the current `index`. However, since the verification fails at the start, indicating that the invariant may not correct or cannot be proven to hold before the first iteration, it's crucial we revise it properly to reflect the nature of our loop.

Given the loop iterates through the array and checks if each element is one less than its immediate successor, the loop invariant should ensure elements examined so far (`index`) are consecutively increasing by one. A simpler, more precise invariant condition we want to maintain throughout the loop is that for any two immediate neighbors from the start to the current `index`, the `arr[i] + 1 == arr[i + 1]` should hold.

However, given the nature of the original invariant, and assuming that there's a misunderstanding of its intention based on the problem description, it's crucial to understand that the invariant in the query does not correctly reflect what it's intended for - checking the immediate successors for consecutiveness within the processed portion of the array.

A corrected invariant under the assumption that we want to ensure consecutiveness among all elements checked so far should actually verify that each element up to the current `index` point and its immediate next element satisfy the consecutiveness condition. However, because we only compare each element with its immediate next, the given invariant is overly complex and doesn't directly apply to the loop's goal.

If the goal is to ensure that each immediate successor pair from the begin to `index` is consecutive:

forall|i: int| 0 <= i < index ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[i + 1]),
This invariant claims that for all elements up to the current `index`, each element is one less than its next elementâ€”a straightforward reflection of the loop's intention to verify consecutive numbers.

Note: The provided invariant might still require adjustment based on the exact requirements. The corrected version aims to reflect a better understanding of the loop's purpose and ensuring it holds at the beginning of the loop (when `index = 0`, the condition trivially holds because there are no `i` satisfying `0 <= i < 0`).

//             forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]),
//   None: forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j])
