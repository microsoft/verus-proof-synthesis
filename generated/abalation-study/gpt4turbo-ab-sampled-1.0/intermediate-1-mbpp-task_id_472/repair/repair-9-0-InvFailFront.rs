forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]),

So the problematic part is assuming it for `j <= index + 1` initially. Given the purpose of your function and how you described what you want the invariant to enforce, the seemingly correct approach would be to ensure no statement within the invariant goes further than `index` (i.e., not `index + 1`) at the loop check. Yet, the provided loop and its invariant don't seem to mismatch unless the description of the goal was initially misaligned.

Given this, and understanding that the program's goal is to ensure each element is increasing by 1 from the previous up to the current index, an initial assertion could instead verify the elements up to the start are consecutive if that's a requirement before the loop. Based on your explanation, though, this doesn't seem to be needed.

Make sure to reassess what needs to be invariant across all loop iterations. If your goal is to check for consecutive numbers strictly, then the invariant expressing that no two selected elements violate this rule up to the next element to inspect should suffice.

If the intention was to enforce strict sequencing in parts already inspected, then the invariant setup might need reconsideration reflecting only parts of `arr` that have been checked, Possibly like this:

rust
forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j < index && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]),


//             forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]),
//   None: forall|i: int, j: int| 0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len() ==> (arr[i] + 1 == arr[j])
