The loop invariant you're trying to assert essentially states that, for any pair of indices `i` and `j` in the array `arr` where `0 <= i < j <= index + 1 && j < arr.len()`, it must be the case that `arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]`. However, the error message suggests that this condition does not hold at the beginning of the loop.

The issue seems to stem from the condition requiring that `arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]` for certain ranges of `i` and `j`. At the start of the loop, before any iterations have occurred (`index == 0`), this invariant cannot hold because there are no two elements `i`, `j` where `i < j <= index + 1` (which implies `i < j <= 1`) that you've verified meet the `arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]` condition. This kind of invariant is more aligned with what you check inside the loop and ensure it is maintained with each iteration.

The corrected invariant should reflect conditions that are true at the beginning of the loop and maintained throughout its execution. Given your loop primarily checks if each pair of consecutive elements in the array satisfies `arr[index] + 1 == arr[index + 1]`, a more appropriate invariant to use would focus on the pieces you can assert from the loop's logic itself:

1. All previous pairs up to `index` satisfy `arr[i] + 1 == arr[i + 1]`.
2. Initial setup variables (`arr.len() > 0`, range checks on `arr[i]`, and `index < arr.len()`) remain true.

However, due to the way you've framed the problem and how Verus interprets the invariants, instead of trying to directly correct this invariant (which is overly complex and possibly incorrect for its intended purpose), focus on what the loop actually guarantees at each step.

The `forall` invariant suggesting that all items up to `index + 1` form consecutive increments isn't quite correct because the loop checks for `arr[index] + 1 != arr[index + 1]` and returns false if the condition doesn't hold, which ensures only consecutive elements up to `index` satisfy the property.

Here's a modification that clarifies the intent:

- **Remove** the problematic invariant condition.
- **Add** either assertions or correct loop invariants.

For your specific case, since the invariant as stated doesn't align well with how your loop is structured or the guarantees it provides, I'd suggest focusing on correct initialization and termination conditions and ensuring the invariants explicitly state what is true at each point in the loop.

Given the nature of your question and the clarification needed, it would be more accurate to refine the invariants to what is logically verifiable right from the loop's start. However, removing the given invariant directly without adding assertions to replace its logic might lose some intended safety checks.

If the goal is to ensure that all pairs of elements checked by the loop satisfy `arr[i] + 1 == arr[i+1]`, consider adding an assertion before the loop to ensure your precondition aligns with your loop invariant, although given your loop logic, it might be more about ensuring each step's correctness during iterations than a static state before entering the loop.
