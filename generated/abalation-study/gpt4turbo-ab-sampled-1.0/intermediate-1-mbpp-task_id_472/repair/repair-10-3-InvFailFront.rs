Given your code and the verification engine's feedback on the loop invariant, it seems that the invariant is not rightly established before the loop begins. This happens because the loop invariant requires that for every pair of indices `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j <= index + 1` and `j < arr.len()`, the condition `arr[i] + 1 == arr[j]` must hold. However, at the very start (before entering the loop), the value of `index` is 0, and no iteration has occurred yet, which may not satisfy this invariant without an initial proof.

The corrected loop invariant should ensure that it is trivially true at the start of the loop (when `index = 0`) and maintain its truth throughout the loop execution. The issue seems to stem from the bounds `(0 <= i < j <= index + 1) && (j < arr.len())` leading to a gap in the logic for verifying at the loop's start.

A more appropriate invariant would accurately reflect the loop's progress and the ensured relation between consecutive elements, considering that the loop checks for consecutive elements being exactly 1 apart.

However, the given invariant seems actually designed appropriately for the loop, as it aims to prove that any two elements up to `index + 1` are consecutive if they meet the specified conditions. The confusion might come from initial conditions when the loop has not yet started.

In fact, your loop invariant should technically be correct for asserting that previous elements satisfy the consecutive property once inside the loop. Still, Verus might not identify it as valid at the start due to initialization conditions. We can try asserting the property directly before the loop to help with this initialization issue, although it might not solve the problem directly in all cases given the dynamics of Verus.

Alternatively, to ensure satisfaction of invariants before loop execution, consider adding an assertion before the loop that directly checks for the basic conditions that would be trivially true or introducing a step that establishes the invariant:

1. Re-check your loop invariant conditions.
2. Ensure that the invariant is minimal and strong enough to hold at the beginning of the loop and after each iteration.

For your specific scenario, the original invariant could be logically sound, but there's an issue convincing Verus of its initial truth. If Verus insists the invariant does not hold, you could introduce a manual assertion (though, technically, it's more about satisfying the verifier than changing logic):

You can assert a condition that is trivially true before the loop begins to satisfy the verifier about the initial loop state. Since the problematic invariant relates to how array elements relate based on their indices, and it's clearly designed around ensuring elements are consecutively increasing by 1, we might not need to "correct" it but rather introduce either an assertion or a comment explaining the logical reasoning to Verus depending on its capabilities to interpret such instructions.

However, since the specific action depends highly on the capabilities of Verus and the context of your verification process, which might not directly support the notion of adding assertions just for verification sake without an actual condition to assert before the loop or modifying the invariant to be trivially true when `index = 0`, I recommend checking if there's a way to hint or direct Verus to re-evaluate the invariant's validity at the loop's start more accurately, possibly by looking into the tool's documentation or support for handling such verification edge cases.
