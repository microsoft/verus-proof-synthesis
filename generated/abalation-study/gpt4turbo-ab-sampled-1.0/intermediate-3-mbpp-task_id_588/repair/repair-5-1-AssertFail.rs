The assertion `assert(max_val as int - min_val as int <= i32::MAX as int);` could fail because it does not consider the updated constraints on `arr[i]` within the `requires` block. The range you've given `i32::MIN / 2 < #[trigger] arr[i] < i32::MAX / 2` effectively ensures that any subtraction between two elements of `arr` will not overflow an `i32`. However, the direct translation of this constraint to ensure safety regarding `i32::MAX` and `i32::MIN` in the context of the subtraction between `max_val` and `min_val` may not be correctly aligning with Verus's understanding of integer ranges and conversions between types.

A better approach would involve asserting properties that directly utilize the constraints provided in the `requires` section regarding the range of values in `arr`. Specifically, since you've assured that each `arr[i]` is between `i32::MIN / 2` and `i32::MAX / 2`, the difference between any two elements (including `max_val` and `min_val`) cannot exceed `i32::MAX / 2 - (i32::MIN / 2)`, which is certainly within the bounds of `i32::MAX`.

Thus, the problematic assertion does not seem strictly necessary given the constraints you've placed on elements of `arr`. The calculation of `diff` as `max_val - min_val` already guarantees not to overflow or underflow based on the constraints on `arr`'s elements.

However, addressing the assertion issue directly requires a clear representation of the underlying logic rather than a line-by-line fix due to the complexity of how Verus handles integer overflows and the casting between Rust's `i32` and Verus's `int`. A reevaluation of the necessity of that specific assertion given your constraints may be warranted, or else a more nuanced assertion that closely mirrors the logic ensuring safety given your constraints on `arr`.

Adjusting the code to satisfy Verus without modifying its logic could involve aligning the ensures clause more closely with the invariants and requirements of your sequence, looking closely at how Verus interprets integer bounds and considering whether the specifics of integer conversion or calculation may be simplified or adjusted to ensure safety within the Verus verification system. Given the specifics of your setup, it seems the logic is sound, but Verus's verification is hitting a point of contention with direct integer bounds assertions on subtractive operations between type-cast values.
