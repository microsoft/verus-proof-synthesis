The assertion `assert(max_val as int - min_val as int <= i32::MAX as int);` fails because it assumes that the difference between `max_val` and `min_val` will always fit within an `i32`, but this doesn't take into account the bounds of `i32` when performing the subtraction in the context of an `int`. Since `int` in Verus can have a wider range than `i32`, and given the specific constraints in the `requires` clause on the elements of the array (`i32::MIN / 2 < arr[i] < i32::MAX / 2`), it would be safer to assert a condition that inherently respects these bounds. 

However, looking at your constraints, the range of any `arr[i]` is restricted to be within `i32::MIN / 2` to `i32::MAX / 2`, which inherently ensures the difference between any two `arr[i]` cannot exceed `i32::MAX` or be lower than `i32::MIN`, thus guaranteeing that overflow cannot occur.

Despite this intrinsic safety given your constraints, the failing assertion might be misleading or possibly misinterpreted. If the intent is to strictly check for overflow within the operation's safety, you should reconsider the necessity of this assertion due to your upfront guarantees about the value range of elements in `arr`. 

If you keep the assertion, you need to reevaluate your approach since, given your constraints on the `arr` values, `max_val - min_val` will never overflow an `i32` by design. Thus, the assertion check might be redundant or need redesigning to reflect other intended safety checks or invariants not explicitly stated in your current version of the code.

Given your requirements and constraints (`arr.len() > 0` and each element is constrained within `i32::MIN / 2` and `i32::MAX / 2`), overflow is inherently prevented in the operation `max_val - min_val`. An assertion failure indicates either a misunderstanding of the constraints or an unnecessary check. Based on the provided context, modifications to satisfy the failed assertion are not strictly necessary under these constraints.
