Your Rust code with Verus annotations already adheres to verifying mathematical properties and correctness within certain boundaries specified in the function's preconditions. The assertion that is failing checks if the difference between the maximal and minimal value from the vector remains within the bounds of an `i32`. Since `max_val` and `min_val` are both of type `i32` and due to your precondition that restricts every element of the array to be strictly less/greater than `i32::MAX/2` and `i32::MIN/2`, respectively, the potential for overflow in normal circumstances is already mitigated.

However, the direct casting to `int` (which in the context of Verus means mathematical integers with no inherent bounds) and then asserting the difference might not inherently assure Verus that an overflow cannot occur due to its abstract interpretation of numbers without considering Rust's concrete bounds.

One way to strengthen the assertion or to guide Verus more explicitly is to reinforce the precondition's implications right before your problematic assertion to bind the abstract mathematical notion of integers closer to Rust's concrete ones. To do so, since the precondition already ensures any individual value is strictly within `i32::MAX / 2` and `i32::MIN / 2`, it guarantees that the difference between any two values cannot exceed `i32::MAX` nor fall below `i32::MIN`. Therefore, the assertion should always hold true under the preconditions given, implying a potential issue in how the verifier interprets the bounds checks.

Since the code and the assertions are logically correct given the boundary conditions defined in the preconditions, it seems like the verifier might have difficulty understanding or applying the constraints implicitly through these mathematical properties. One common approach to address such an issue in formal verification, when the tooling does not seem to apply or recognize your precondition constraints directly in proofs, is explicitly adding assumptions (if the toolchain supports it) or breaking down the assertion into simpler forms that the tool can more readily verify.

Given that the Verus toolchain for Rust doesn't typically support direct assumptions in the same way some other formal verification tools do, and that your precondition should explicitly cover the safety of the assertion, revising the assertion itself might not directly resolve the issue if it's rooted in tooling limitations.

Given the scope and the details provided, and without direct means to augment Verus' inference capabilities in this regard, you might need to:

1. Re-check the compatibility and the current limitations of the Verus verifier with respect to handling Rust's concrete type bounds against its own mathematical integers.
2. Ensure that the version of Verus you're using is up-to-date and see if there are known issues or limitations around this kind of verification.
3. Consult Verus documentation or community resources for any known workarounds for similar issues. 

There might not be a straightforward fix or adjustment to be made directly in your code that will change the outcome of this specific assertion failing without further guidance or updates from the tooling (Verus) perspective.

//     assert(max_val as int - min_val as int <= i32::MAX as int);
//   assertion failed: max_val as int - min_val as int <= i32::MAX as int

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 30
