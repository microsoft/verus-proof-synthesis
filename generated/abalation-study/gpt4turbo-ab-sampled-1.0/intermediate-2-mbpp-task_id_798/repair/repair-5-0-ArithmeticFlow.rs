forall |i: int| 0 <= i && i < index as int ==> 
    i128::MIN - arr@[i] as i128 <= sum && sum + arr@[i] as i128 <= i128::MAX,
This invariant suggests that for any index `i` up to the current `index`, the sum after adding the `i`th element of `arr` is within `i128` bounds. Nonetheless, to directly address the mission's requirements and explicitly assert the bound of `sum + arr[index] as i128` before it happens, we can incorporate a similar condition as part of our invariant or assert directly if possible.

Given your scenario, the solution lies more in ensuring the loop invariant covers the scenario properly rather than adding a new function. To stick closely to the guidelines, let's add an explicit assertion right before the sum changes, to clarify our intentions and make it explicit. Also, ensuring our invariants cover the condition adequately is essential:

rust
// Updated version of the loop snippet to include an explicit assertion for clarity

while index < arr.len()
    invariant
        index <= arr.len(),
        sum == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)) as i128,
        arr.len() == arr@.len(), // loop invariant for the "arr" length
        // Ensuring sum stays within i128 bounds
        i128::MIN <= sum && sum <= i128::MAX,
        // Ensure that adding any element from `arr` to `sum` stays within bounds for the upcoming element as well
        forall |i: int| 0 <= i && i <= index as int ==> 
            i128::MIN - arr@[i] as i128 <= sum && sum + arr@[i] as i128 <= i128::MAX,
{
    assert(i128::MIN <= sum + arr[index] as i128 && sum + arr[index] as i128 <= i128::MAX); // Explicit assertion for clarity
    sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
    index += 1;
}


//             sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
//   None: sum + arr[index] as i128
