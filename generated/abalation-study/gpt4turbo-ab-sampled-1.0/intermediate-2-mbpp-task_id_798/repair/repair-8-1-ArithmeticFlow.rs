This already provides a comprehensive guarantee concerning the addition's safety in terms of arithmetic bounds. To adhere strictly to the task, ensuring no underflow/overflow before the given line, this specific assertion seems extra but for completeness, here's how you might explicitly place such an assertion:

rust
            assert(i128::MIN <= sum + arr[index] as i128 && sum + arr[index] as i128 <= i128::MAX);
            sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;


//             sum = sum + arr[index] as i128;
//   None: sum + arr[index] as i128

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 3
// Safe: False
