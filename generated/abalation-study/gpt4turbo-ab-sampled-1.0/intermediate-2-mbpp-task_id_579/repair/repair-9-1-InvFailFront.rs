The invariant `forall|i: int| 0 <= i < result.len() ==> (!arr1@.contains(#[trigger] result[i]))` states that for all elements currently in `result`, none are contained in `arr1`. This invariant should hold true from the beginning, but Verus cannot verify this prior to the loop execution. One way to address this is by ensuring we establish this fact right before the loop starts or by adding assumptions that allow Verus to deduce this fact.

For the problem statement, assuming this invariant fails at the beginning implies we need to demonstrate the invariant holds true before the loop. This can involve initializing conditions or inserting assertions to ensure the property holds. However, being a loop invariant for the second loop, it actually reflects a misunderstanding of the message, since the invariant referenced is about the first loop in which `result` is filled based on `arr1` and checked against `arr2`.

The reported problem comes from the second loop's invariant related to `arr1`, and because it talks about `result` vector being dissimilar from components in `arr1`, the issue seems to come from a misunderstanding or a wrong message about invariants from the engine.

Given the code context, the invariant itself appears correct: before the second loop, `result` only contains elements from `arr1` that aren't in `arr2` and none of these should be able to violate the condition unless `arr1` has duplicates or similar issues not handled here. The problem might come from a few angles:

1. **Assumptions**: It's worth ensuring or asserting any assumptions about `arr1` or `arr2` that ensure no duplicates or other conditions might implicitly affect this loop invariant.

2. **Initialization**: Ensure that the `result` vector's initial state aligns with the assumption. Before the loop, assert the condition as an explicit check to help pinpoint the issue:

    rust
    assert!(forall|i: int| 0 <= i < result.len() ==> (!arr1@.contains(result[i])));
    

//             forall|i: int| 0 <= i < result.len() ==> (!arr1@.contains(#[trigger] result[i])),
//   None: forall|i: int| 0 <= i < result.len() ==> (!arr1@.contains(#[trigger] result[i]))

// Safe: False
