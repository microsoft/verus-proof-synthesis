The assertion `assert(max_val - min_val <= i32::MAX / 2);` could fail due to incorrect assumptions about the range within which `max_val` and `min_val` can vary based on the assumptions provided in the function's `requires` clause. The requirements ensure that each element of the vector `arr` is strictly less than `i32::MAX / 2` and strictly greater than `i32::MIN / 2`. However, even within these constraints, the difference between `max_val` and `min_val` can still be up to `i32::MAX - 1` if `min_val` and `max_val` are around the middle of the `i32` range. 

Considering `i32::MAX / 2` is roughly half of the maximum value an `i32` can hold, the assertion seems to aim at preventing overflow. To ensure it reliably does so, we need to adjust the invariant and possibly the logic around `min_val` and `max_val` so the assertion correctly reflects the constraints the inputs are under. Unfortunately, correcting the assertion to match the precondition directly isn't straightforward due to the difference calculation.

To avoid potential overflow or underflow when calculating the difference, we can use checked subtraction and update our logic to handle the possibility that this subtraction might fail, reflecting that the difference might exceed the allowable `i32` bounds. However, the direct addressing of the failed assertion does not seem logically reconcilable with the input constraints as-is, since `i32::MAX / 2 - (i32::MIN / 2)` still exceeds `i32::MAX / 2`. This indicates an oversight in the premise that leads to this assertion.

Adding comments without altering the intended functionality of your code while addressing the specific assertion failure isn't straightforward without revising the underlying assumptions or the way `max_val` and `min_val` are handled. The resolution would ideally involve revisiting the requirement that `diff == max_rcur(arr@) - min_rcur(arr@)` under the conditions given, or to introduce a more nuanced way to handle the extreme values and their difference within the `i32` range.

Given these considerations, a generic solution or bypass would alter the intent and correctness of your code substantially, which requires a more complex restructuring beyond the direct fix for the assertion failure. Therefore, a simple and direct code amendment for this specific assertion failure while preserving the logical correctness and constraints, unfortunately, does not seem immediately feasible without additional context or adjustments to the broader logic or requirements specified.
