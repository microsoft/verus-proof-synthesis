Your Rust code with Verus annotations appears to correctly calculate the sum of elements in a given `Vec<i64>` and compares it against a specification function `sum_to(arr: Seq<i64>) -> int` that recursively calculates the sum. The error you are encountering relates to the post-condition `sum_to(arr@) == sum` failing to be satisfied at the end of the `sum` function.

The post-condition failure suggests that the relationship between the calculated sum within the loop and the expected sum as defined by `sum_to` is not being correctly established. Given the invariant `sum == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)) as i128`, you ensure that at each step of the loop, the partial sum corresponds to the sum calculated by `sum_to` for the subrange of the array from `0` to `index`.

Looking over the provided invariant and the loop structure, it seems the code is correctly designed to ensure the post-condition should hold. Thus, the issue does not appear to be with the logical structure of the proof or code.

However, ensuring that the loop invariant fully captures the necessary conditions to prove the post-condition is crucial. Your invariant already does this well by relating `sum` to a call to `sum_to` over the subrange `arr@.subrange(0, index as int)` and by ensuring the sum does not overflow the bounds of an `i128`. The `proof` block inside the loop that invokes `lemma_sum_to_bounds` ostensibly ensures sum does not overflow, which is essential for the correctness of the addition operation in the loop.

Given the error report, the issue likely lies not in the logic of your proof or loop invariant but might be a result of how the final state of `sum` is communicated or calculated regarding its post-condition. Given the information provided and ensuring other aspects of the code outside this snippet are correct, the provided code segment seems logically sound for the specific post-condition failure described.

One potential subtle issue might be with the conversion and handling of types between `i64`, `i128`, and `int`, especially since `sum_to` returns an `int` and `sum` is an `i128`. Ensure that the conversions between these types throughout the loop and in the relation established by the loop invariant do not inadvertently introduce discrepancies. 

Since there's no specific change indicated for solving the reported issue based on the provided code and the error report, the code as is seems to be designed correctly to fulfill its specification under the assumptions made. It might be worth verifying the entire context in which `sum` and `sum_to` are used, including any auxiliary functions or specifications (`lemma_sum_to_bounds`, `lemma_seq_subrange_all`, `lemma_seq_subrange_ascend`) for potential issues not captured by the snippet provided.
