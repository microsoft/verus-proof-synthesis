Changes made:

1. Removed redundant invariants inside the `while` loop:
   rust
   forall|i: u64| 2 <= i < factor ==> !(divides(i as nat, candidate as nat)),
   forall|k: nat| 2 <= k < factor ==> !divides(k, candidate as nat),

These invariants were redundant as they were covered by the primary invariant:
   rust 
   forall|f: nat| 2 <= f < factor ==> !divides(f, candidate as nat),
