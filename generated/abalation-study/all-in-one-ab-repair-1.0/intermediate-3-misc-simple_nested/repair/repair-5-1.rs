### Key Changes and Additions:
1. **Requires Clause**: Added the range check for `k` within the `requires` clause to ensure `k` only spans valid indices.
2. **Invariants**:
   - Improved the invariants to carry through the logical equivalence and relationships between `a` and `b`.
   - Ensured the conditions of the inner loop cover all necessary elements and relationships.

### Explanation:

- **Requires Clause**:
  rust
  forall|k: int| 0 <= k < N ==> -0x3FFF_FFFF <= b[k] <= k + 1
  Ensures that `k` is within bounds and `b[k]` is bounded between `-0x3FFF_FFFF` and `k + 1`.

- **Invariants**:
  Inside the outer and inner loops:
  rust
  a.len() == N as usize,
  Ensures the length of `a` remains `N`.

- Relations between `a` and `b` values and loop variables (`i` and `j`) are maintained correctly:
  rust
  forall|k: int| 0 <= k < i ==> a[k as int] == b[k as int] + 1 - (k as i32)
