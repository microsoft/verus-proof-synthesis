### Explanation

1. **Variable Types**: Ensure that `counter` is of type `u64` to match the function signature.
2. **Type Casting**: Utilize type casting to ensure that the comparison between `count_boolean` results and `counter` values are type compatible.
3. **Invariants**:
   - Ensure that `counter` is compatible with `count_boolean` types.
   - The invariant `index < arr.len()` is unnecessary because `index <= arr.len()` already covers it.
   
This should address the issues and errors identified in your code.

### Execution

Ensure that you are running the compiler command correctly without multiple input filenames. If you're using an IDE, double-check your settings to make sure there aren't conflicting inputs. If you continue facing issues, consider running it from the command line with a higher error reporting setting:

sh
verus --multiple-errors=10 your_file.rs


// error: multiple input filenames provided (first two filenames are `` and `/tmp/tmp5bthnnxi`)
// 

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 19
// Safe: False
