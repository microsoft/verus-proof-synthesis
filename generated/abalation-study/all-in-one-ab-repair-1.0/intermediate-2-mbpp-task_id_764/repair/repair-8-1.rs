        count

In the previous implementation, I had already addressed most of the correctness requirements. Below is a summary of key considerations and validations met by the updated code:

1. `0 <= count <= index`: The `count` variable is never less than `0` or greater than the `index`, as `count` is only incremented within the loop.
2. `index <= text.len()`: The `index` simply increments from `0` to `text.len() - 1`.
3. `count_digits_recursively(text@.subrange(0, index as int)) == count`: This spec ensures that at each step in the loop, the count calculated so far is consistent with the number of digits in the `text` up to the `index`.

Moreover, at the end, we can ensure that the postconditions are met by returning the final count directly, with the loop invariant maintaining the desired state throughout the program execution stream:

rust
// Proof checks at the end of the function
assert(0 <= count);
assert(count <= text.len());
assert(count_digits_recursively(text@) == count);
