Explanation of the Invariants used:

1. `0 <= count <= index`: The count of uppercase letters so far must be between 0 and the current index.
2. `0 <= index <= text.len()`: The current index must be within the bounds of the text.
3. `text.len() == text.len()`: This is redundant but ensures that the length of the text doesn't change.
4. `count_uppercase_recursively(text@.take(index as int)) == count as int`: Ensures that the recursive function correctly reflects the count of uppercase letters up to the current index.

Note: There was an invariant in your original code to prove that each character is either lowercase or uppercase, but it isn't directly necessary for this function to work correctly. If you want to keep it for any specific reason, make sure the character set verification logic matches the function scope.

Make sure to run the code with the appropriate Verus command, ensuring proper arguments and paths are specified:
