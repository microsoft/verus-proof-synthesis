### Explanation of Invariants
In the first `while` loop:
- `0 < n < list@.len()`: Ensure `n` is strictly between zero and the length of the list.
- `list@.len() > 0`: Ensure the length of `list` is greater than zero.
- `n <= index <= list.len()`: Ensure `index` is in the range from `n` to the end of the list.
- `new_list@ == list@.subrange(n as int, index as int)`: Ensure that `new_list` matches the subrange of `list` from position `n` to `index`.

In the second `while` loop:
- `0 < n < list@.len()`: Ensure `n` is strictly between zero and the length of the list.
- `0 <= index <= n`: Ensure `index` is in the range from zero to `n`.
- `list@.len() > 0`: Ensure the length of `list` is greater than zero.
- `new_list@ == list@.subrange(n as int, list@.len() as int).add(list@.subrange(0, index as int))`: Ensure that `new_list` matches the concatenation of `list` subranges `[n..end]` and `[0..index]`.

### Handling the Multiple Filenames Issue
The error `multiple input filenames provided` seems to suggest that the execution or compilation command might have improper usage, causing the system to think there are multiple files being processed simultaneously. Ensure that the command to compile or verify this file specifies just one input file.

For instance, if you are running a command like the following, make sure to input just the correct file:
sh
verus yourfile.rs


// error: multiple input filenames provided (first two filenames are `` and `/tmp/tmpgh3y7clt`)
// 

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 55
// Safe: False
