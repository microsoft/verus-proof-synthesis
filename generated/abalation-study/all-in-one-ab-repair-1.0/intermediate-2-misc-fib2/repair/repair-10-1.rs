### Explanation of Key Elements:

1. **Invariants in the While Loop:**
    - `2 <= i <= n`: Ensures `i` remains within the valid range throughout the computation.
    - `fib.len() == i`: Ensures the length of the vector `fib` is always equal to the index `i`.
    - `fibo_fits_i32(n as int)`: Reiterates that the Fibonacci number for `n` fits within the bounds of `i32`.
    - `forall|j: int| 0 <= j < i ==> #[trigger] fib@[j] == fibo(j as int)`: Ensures that all elements in `fib` up to index `i` match the expected Fibonacci values.

2. **Ensures Block:**
    - `forall|i: int| 0 <= i < n ==> #[trigger] ret@[i] == fibo(i)`: Validates that all elements in the returned vector `ret` match the corresponding Fibonacci values.
    - `ret@.len() == n`: Validates the length of the returned vector meets the specified length `n`.

### Running the Verification

Ensure you are running the verification command correctly, as the error might be related to the execution rather than the code itself. If you encounter issues, it could be useful to check your execution environment for any discrepancies or misconfigurations.

### Command Example

sh
verus test.rs


// error: multiple input filenames provided (first two filenames are `` and `/tmp/tmpllatbbdi`)
// 

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 31
// Safe: False
