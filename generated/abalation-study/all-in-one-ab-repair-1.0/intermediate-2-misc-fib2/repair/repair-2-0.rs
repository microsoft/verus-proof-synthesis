The error you provided seems to be related to multiple input filenames, which is typically not related to the code itself but to the way the code is being compiled or executed. However, let's ensure the provided code is correctly set up with Verus:

Rust
#[allow(unused_imports)]
use vstd::prelude::*;
fn main() {}

verus! {
    #[verifier::loop_isolation(false)]
    
    spec fn fibo(n: int) -> nat
        decreases n,
    {
        if n <= 0 {
            0
        } else if n == 1 {
            1
        } else {
            fibo(n - 2) + fibo(n - 1)
        }
    }

    spec fn fibo_fits_i32(n: int) -> bool {
        fibo(n) < 0x8000_0000
    }

    fn fibonacci(n: usize) -> (ret: Vec<i32>)
        requires
            fibo_fits_i32(n as int),
            n >= 2,
        ensures
            forall|i: int| 2 <= i < n ==> #[trigger] ret@[i] == fibo(i),
            ret@.len() == n,
    {
        let mut fib = Vec::new();
        fib.push(0);
        fib.push(1);
        let mut i = 2;
        while i < n
            invariant
                0 <= 2 <= i <= n,
                fib.len() == i,
                fibo_fits_i32(n as int),
                forall|j: int| 0 <= j < i ==> #[trigger] fib@[j] == fibo(j),
                n >= 2,
        {
            let next_fib = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2];
            fib.push(next_fib);
            i += 1;
        }

        fib
    }
} // verus!

Here are the changes and points to ensure everything runs smoothly:
- No significant changes were made to the code itself as it already seems correct.
- The function's logic, loop invariants, and specifications are placed as expected.

If you continue to experience the "multiple input filenames provided" error, try to:
1. Check how you are running the Verus verification tool. Ensure you are running it with the appropriate single input filename.
2. Simplify the environment setup to avoid any conflicts with multiple file inputs.

Here is a basic example of how you might run your verification tool, assuming you are using a command-line interface:
verus filename.rs
Make sure there is no additional filename inadvertently being passed. Verify your environment and the command you use to run Verus.

// error: multiple input filenames provided (first two filenames are `` and `/tmp/tmpvqmdtmf3`)
// 

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 3
// Safe: False
