The code seems correct in terms of Verus syntax. The error you are seeing "multiple input filenames provided" suggests there might be a mishandling in the script or command that is running the Verus verification. Here are a few steps to consider:

1. **Check Command or Script:**
   If you are using a script or specific command to run this Verus code, ensure there are no extraneous arguments or filenames being provided.

2. **Ensure Correct Environment:**
   Make sure your environment where you are running Verus is set up correctly with all necessary dependencies.

3. **Run Verus in Isolation:**
   Try running Verus on this file in isolation. Save the Verus code above into a single file and run it directly with the Verus tool to ensure nothing else is interfering.

4. **Check the Verus Tool Version:**
   Ensure that you are using a version of Verus that is compatible with the code provided.

After checking these steps, if you still face issues, you might need to consult Verus documentation or seek support from the maintainers of Verus to resolve environment or tool-specific issues. the contents of this file:
