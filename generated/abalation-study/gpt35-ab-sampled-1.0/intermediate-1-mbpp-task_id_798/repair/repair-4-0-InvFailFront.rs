It looks like the loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is failing at the beginning of the loop. This means that the specified invariant is not true when the loop starts.

One potential reason for this could be that the `sum_to` function is not returning the expected result for the subrange of the array.

Given the context provided, I recommend re-evaluating the `sum_to` function and its behavior for subranges, as well as its relationship with the loop invariant. Consider verifying that the `sum_to` function is correctly implemented and fulfills the expected behavior for subranges.

After ensuring the correctness of the `sum_to` function, you should reevaluate the loop invariant and verify that it accurately captures the expected behavior at the beginning of the loop. If necessary, adjust the loop invariant to accurately reflect the expected state at the loop entry point.

If these steps do not resolve the issue, consider adding asserts right before the loop to validate the loop invariant and the behavior of the `sum_to` function for the specific subrange.

It might be helpful to break down the `sum_to` and loop invariant separately to isolate and address any issues with their behavior individually.

//             forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)),
//   None: forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))
