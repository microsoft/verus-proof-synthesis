forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))
does not hold at the beginning of the loop.

This loop invariant may not be valid for the loop's initial execution, which is why the Verus engine is reporting a failure. An invariant is a condition that should be true before and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, the initial condition of the loop to hold the invariant is not satisfied.

We can resolve this by adding the invariant as an assert right before the loop, ensuring that it holds before the loop begins, or we can correct the loop invariant by making it more suitable for the initial state.

Let's address this by adding the loop invariant as an assert right before the loop. Here's the modified code:

rust
fn sum(arr: &Vec<i64>) -> i128
    ensures
        sum_to(arr@) == sum,
{
    assert(forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, 0 as int)));
    let mut index = 0;
    let mut sum = 0i128;
    while index < arr.len()
        invariant
            index <= arr.len(),
            forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)),
    {
        // ... rest of the code remains unchanged
    }
    sum
}


//             forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)),
//   None: forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))
