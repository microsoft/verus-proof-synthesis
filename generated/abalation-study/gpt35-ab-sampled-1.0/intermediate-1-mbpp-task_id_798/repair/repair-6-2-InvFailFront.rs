The failed invariant suggests that the loop invariant is not holding at the beginning of the loop. This means that the condition `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is not satisfied initially.

Looking at your code, the loop invariant you have provided is attempting to express a relationship between the sub-ranges of the array `arr` and the `sum_to` function. However, it seems that the loop invariant is not well-formed.

The loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` does not seem directly related to the loop's progress or the loop's behavior. It may not be the correct loop invariant for your program.

To resolve this, you can consider the following strategies:
1. Correct the loop invariant to accurately capture the relationship between the loop's state and the desired properties of the program.
2. If the loop invariant does indeed represent an important property that should hold at the beginning of the loop, consider adding it as an assertion right before the loop to check its validity.

Please review the loop invariant and ensure that it accurately represents a property that should hold at the beginning of each iteration of the loop. If the invariant is essential to the correctness of your program, and it should hold at the beginning of each iteration, then consider adding it as an assertion before the loop.

After making the appropriate changes, you can retry the verification using the Verus tool to ensure that the loop invariant holds as expected.
