It looks like the Verus verifier is indicating that the loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is not holding at the beginning of the loop.

The issue could be related to the usage of `index` in the loop invariant. It's possible that the value of `index` is not suitable to be used directly in the loop invariant before the loop has started. 

I suggest providing a more appropriate loop invariant that does not rely on the value of `index` before the loop starts. Also, consider adding an `assert` statement right before the loop to make sure the loop invariant holds initially.

Further, in case this loop is part of a larger program with multiple loops, ensure that the loop invariant is also added to all preceding loops to maintain consistency.

//             forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)),
//   None: forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))
