The loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is failing before the loop. This means that the condition specified in the invariant is not true at the beginning of the loop. 

In order to fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the loop invariant holds true when the loop begins. You can do this by adding the assertion `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, 0 as int))` immediately before the loop. This will verify the invariant at the start of the loop, allowing Verus to proceed with the verification process.

//             forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)),
//   None: forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 5
// Safe: False
