Based on the error message, it seems that the loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` may not hold at the beginning of the loop.

One common reason for this failure could be related to the initialization of variables or the specified loop invariant itself.

Here are a few things to consider and potentially modify:

1. Initialization: Ensure that the loop invariant is true at the start of the loop. This may involve validating that the initial state of the variables satisfies the loop invariant.

2. Loop variant: Verify that the loop variant (`index < arr.len()`) is consistent with the loop invariant and that the loop variant is correctly updated within the loop body.

3. Lemmas: Check that the lemmas used in the loop body (`lemma_monotonic_sum_to`) are correctly applied and their preconditions hold at the loop entry.

4. Sequence operations: Ensure that the operations on the sequence `arr` and its subrange are consistent with the loop invariant.

It's important to ensure that the loop invariant is true at the beginning of the loop and is maintained throughout the execution of the loop.

Additionally, you might want to consider adding the loop invariant as an assert right before the loop to ensure that it holds at the loop entry.

After making these considerations and potential modifications, you can re-run the verification in Verus to validate the loop invariant.
