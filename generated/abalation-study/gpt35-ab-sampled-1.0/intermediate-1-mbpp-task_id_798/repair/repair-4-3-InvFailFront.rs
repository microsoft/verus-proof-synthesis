The loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` does not hold at the beginning of the loop. 

After reviewing the code, it seems that the loop invariant is meant to ensure that the sum of elements up to index `k` is equal to the sum of elements up to the current index `index`. However, the calculation of the sum within the loop can lead to a changing value for `sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))`, making the invariant not hold at the start of the loop.

To resolve this issue, you might consider adding the loop invariant as an assert right before the loop it belongs to, rather than as an invariant within the loop. This way, you can ensure that the invariant holds at the entry point of the loop and then at the exit point. Additionally, ensure that the loop logic maintains the invariant during each iteration.

Alternatively, you may consider revising the loop invariant to better reflect the invariants that should hold at the beginning and end of each iteration.

Reviewing the preconditions, postconditions, and loop invariants and verifying their correctness should address this error. If you need further assistance in making these adjustments, feel free to ask.
