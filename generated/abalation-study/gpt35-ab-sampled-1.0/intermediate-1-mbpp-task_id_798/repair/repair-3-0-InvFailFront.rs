It looks like the loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is failing before the loop in your code. It seems like the loop invariant is not established at the beginning of the loop.

The loop invariant is intended to hold true before and after each iteration of the loop. In this case, it seems that the loop invariant being specified may not hold at the beginning of the loop due to the way the `sum_to` function is being used inside the loop and the loop iteration logic itself.

To address this, you should carefully review the loop invariant and the logic of the loop to ensure that the specified invariant holds true at the beginning of the loop. If it does not, you may need to refine the loop invariant or review the loop logic to ensure that the invariant is not violated.

Additionally, you may also consider using assertions within the loop to verify the loop invariant if necessary.

I would suggest revisiting the loop invariant and the loop logic to ensure that the specified invariant is valid at the beginning of the loop. If necessary, refine the loop invariant or use assertions inside the loop to verify the invariant.
