It looks like the loop invariant `forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))` is not holding at the beginning of the loop.

The loop invariant suggests that for any index 'k' within the range of the array, the sum of the subrange from the beginning of the array to 'k' is equal to the sum of the subrange from the beginning of the array to the current index 'index'.

To address this issue, you may want to ensure that the loop invariant holds at the beginning of the loop. You could add an assert statement before the loop to check the validity of the loop invariant or modify the invariant to reflect the actual state of the array at the start of the loop.

Alternatively, if there are preceding loops in the program, you may need to add the loop invariant to those preceding loops as well. This would ensure that the necessary conditions are met before entering the loop in question.

I would recommend reviewing the loop invariant and potentially adding an assert statement before the loop to verify the invariant or checking preceding loops for the same invariant.
