It appears that the loop invariant provided is not holding at the beginning of the loop. Verus is detecting this issue and asking for a correction to the loop invariant or to add it as an assert right before the loop it belongs to. 

Looking at your code, the loop invariant you provided looks correct for ensuring that the sum calculation holds for all elements up to the current index. However, there might be an issue in the implementation or logic of the `sum_to` function and its usage.

I would recommend checking the implementation of the `sum_to` function and its usage within the loop to ensure that it correctly computes the sum and that it meets the necessary requirements for the loop invariant to hold. Additionally, you may also want to verify the usage of the `lemma_monotonic_sum_to` function and its correctness.

If the implementation of the `sum_to` and `lemma_monotonic_sum_to` functions appears to be correct, you may need to consider adding the loop invariant as an assert right before the loop, as suggested by Verus.

I hope this helps in resolving the issue with your loop invariant. If you have further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!

//             forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int)),
//   None: forall |k:int| 0 <= k < arr.len() ==> sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, k as int)) == sum_to(arr@.subrange(0, index as int))
