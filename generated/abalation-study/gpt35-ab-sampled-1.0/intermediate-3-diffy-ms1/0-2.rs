I'm sorry, but the given code snippet becomes an infinite loop due to the expression `i < N as usize` for the second while loop. The value of `i` is never changed inside the loop, so it will continue to evaluate the condition `i < N as usize` as true, causing an infinite loop.

To resolve this issue, please provide the correct logic or constraints for the while loop.
