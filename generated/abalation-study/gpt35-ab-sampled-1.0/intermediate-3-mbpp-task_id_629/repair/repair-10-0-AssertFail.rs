It looks like you've added the `reveal(Seq::filter);` command at the beginning of the `find_even_numbers` function to assist Verus in understanding the `filter` operation. This will help Verus in understanding and proving anything related to `filter`. Is there anything else that I can assist you with?

//         assert(even_numbers@ == arr@.filter(|x: u32| x % 2 == 0)); // Added by AI
//   assertion failed: even_numbers@ == arr@.filter(|x: u32| x % 2 == 0)

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 10
// Safe: False
