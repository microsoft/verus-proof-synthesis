It looks like the loop invariant `old(sum).len() == 1` is causing a failure before the loop. This may be because the value of `sum.len()` may not necessarily be 1 at the beginning of the loop. 

We need to ensure that the loop invariants are true before the loop starts. In the code you provided, the loop invariant `sum.len() == 1` is part of the loop, but it may not hold true at the start of the loop.

I can suggest a few possible solutions:
1. If the `sum.len()` should indeed be 1 at the start of the loop, then we need to investigate why the invariant is failing to hold at the loop entry point.
2. If the `sum.len()` being equal to 1 should be guaranteed before the loop, then we can add it as an assertion right before the loop.

Let me know which approach you want to take and, if necessary, I can help further.
