It seems that the failed invariant is `old(sum).len() == 1`. The error message suggests that this invariant does not hold before the loop starts. Since there are no loops before the current one, you can add this invariant as an assert right before the loop it belongs to. Here's how you can do it:

assert!(old(sum).len() == 1);

This assert should be added before the first while loop in the program. This way, the assertion will check if the condition holds before the loop starts, and the Verus verification engine should no longer report this error.

//                 sum.len() == 1,
//   None: sum.len() == 1

// Compilation Error: True, Verified: -1, Errors: 999, Verus Errors: 4
// Safe: False
